<p>Been up tonight, doing some planning and such.&nbsp; Figured out my taxes and planning for buying some things for when we move in together (put the security deposit down on our new apartment last Sunday).</p>
<p>Then was thinking about the honeymoon and checked out the availability for the cruise we were planning to take.&nbsp; They were down to 5 balcony suites left, so I decided to go ahead and book it.</p>
<p>One step closer to being a married man&hellip;</p>
