<p>Been enjoying my new Thinkpad T60.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I finally I finally broke down and ordered a new laptop.&nbsp; I was originally thinking about getting&nbsp;a new laptop about a year ago, but decided not to as there were some newer things coming like the Core 2 Duo chips.&nbsp; Then back in November, I decided to upgrade my desktop some rather than a laptop.&nbsp; I was kind of looking at it with the attitude that it wasn&#39;t worth upgrading my laptop because I don&#39;t use it that much, but I didn&#39;t use it that much because it was too slow and I didn&#39;t like using it.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, before my trip to Dallas, I&#39;d decided to put Vista on my laptop and give it a shot.&nbsp; I figured, maybe seeing how Vista performed on it would help me determine whether I really needed a new laptop.&nbsp; First, I had a bunch of trouble as I found the DVD drive on my laptop was on its way out, as I couldn&#39;t even get it to copy all of the files off the Vista disk when installing.&nbsp; After a few days, I managed to find my USB DVD drive and got the Vista install done the day before I was leaving for Dallas.&nbsp; Once I get it on there though, I found Vista was <em>horrendously</em> slow.&nbsp; I mean, the laptop was an old Pentium M 1.7ghz, 1gb RAM, some old horrible ATI chipset.&nbsp; The laptop was probably about 3 years old.</p> <p>Then, while I was in Dallas, I found that the period key was starting to go bad.&nbsp; I had to hit it pretty decisively for it to work.&nbsp; That was the last straw.&nbsp; I had been comparing laptops a lot recently, deals at different places, and knew what I wanted and from where.&nbsp; I just hadn&#39;t reached the point of pulling the trigger.&nbsp; When I found the period key going, that was it.&nbsp; I placed the order while there in Dallas.</p> <p>The system I&#39;d narrowed it down to was a new Thinkpad T60 to replace my old Thinkpad T40.&nbsp; I ended up ordering it through Lenovo, as I found you can get a pretty nice deal if you link to them and order with your Visa.&nbsp; Visa offers about a 15% discount on the T60.&nbsp; By ordering that way, the deal was better than almost anything I&#39;d seen on other vendors or even on Ebay.&nbsp; Also, I wanted the Thinkpad rather than anything else like a Dell.&nbsp; Thinkpads have always impressed me, and Dells don&#39;t always.&nbsp; Dell didn&#39;t have anything that quite met the Thinkpad.&nbsp; Sure, they have 15.4&quot; widescreens with WSXGA+, but most of their systems cap at 2.33ghz.&nbsp; Comparing the ones that are close to it (not counting the processor), the Thinkpad was only about $100-200 more than it.&nbsp; The only Dell that compared to the Thinkpad on everything, including processor, was the Latitude D820.&nbsp; When I priced it, it ended up being about $150 <em>more</em> than the Thinkpad was.&nbsp; In general, I think the Thinkpads have actually come down in price.&nbsp; I paid about as much for this as for my old T40 used, and this is more cutting edge than that was at the time.</p> <p>It took a few weeks for them to assembly, package, and ship the system, but one nice thing is that it came in only two days from Hong Kong once being shipped!&nbsp; It came earlier in the weekend and I&#39;ve been loving it so far.&nbsp; It is bigger than my old 14&quot; T40, but overall it is a sweet machine.&nbsp; I have just about everything set up on it, except for finding a way to tether through my&nbsp;Blackberry in Vista.&nbsp; The modem drivers don&#39;t seem to be recognized on Vista.&nbsp; Lenovo is still making the Thinkpads as they&#39;ve always been: sleek, performant, and rugged.</p>
