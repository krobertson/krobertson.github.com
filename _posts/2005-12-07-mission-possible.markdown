<P>Setting this mission for myself for this evening: get my site up to date to the latest Community Server beta build and the latest versions of all&nbsp;the related add-ins that I use.&nbsp; It is kind of shameful that I am a developer at Telligent and not even using our latest public RTM version.</P>
<P>Why this sudden interest?&nbsp; Because I've been working on some cool new stuff that I want to use here, but can't because I'm two versions behind.&nbsp; So, lets see how difficult this will be...</P>
