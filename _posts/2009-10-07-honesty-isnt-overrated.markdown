<p>Last Friday, I had to go to pick up a piece of furniture with my dad that we'd been waiting for.  We'd told them we'd be in at 5pm to pack it up, and they'd said they'd have it there from their warehouse before then.  Sure enough, we get there at 5pm on the dot, and it is still at their warehouse.  Luckily it is only 3 block away, so we follow the owner over there to pick it up.</p>

<p>When we get there, he says that he could make up a million excuses about why he didn't have it there by 5, but the truth was he just forgot.  His wife told him that morning it needed to be there by 5, but he forgot.</p>

<p>It may seem minor, but I was impressed he was so frank.  Most places would act like they had no idea, it was someone else's fault, or somehow your fault.  When we got there and he said it was still at their warehouse, I was rolling my eyes, but when we left, was saying no problem and didn't mind at all.</p>
