<p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial size=2><span>Then my mission is accomplished.&nbsp; Yes, if this post works, I got successfully setup Community Server :: Mail on my machine and enabled the blog-by-email functionality that will be coming to CS v2.0 when the Mail add-on is installed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial size=2><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font><font face=Arial size=2><span>Also, got my site updated to CS v2.0 tonight.&nbsp; The skins for the Photos section still needs quite a bit of work, but it isn’t too bad.&nbsp; Will work on that soon.&nbsp; The change wasn’t too bad.&nbsp; I had updated my site’s skin for CS v1.1, and the changes for v2.0 were minimal (well, for the blogs).&nbsp; Also, setting up a single blog/gallery is far easier in v2.0.&nbsp; It was pretty easy in v1.1 with my little generator (<a title=http://qgyen.net/csaddins/singlesite/ href="http://qgyen.net/csaddins/singlesite/">http://qgyen.net/csaddins/singlesite/</a>), but it is more out of the box in v2.0.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class=MsoNormal><font face=Arial size=2><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></font><font face=Arial size=2><span>All and all, pretty successful evening.&nbsp; Still got a little tidying up to do though.</span></font></p></div>
