<p>Even though I&#39;ve been on Vista full time since RC2, I haven&#39;t <em>really</em> done all that much with the Sidebar yet.</p> <p>One thing I have been despirately wanting is a quick and easy way to launch remote desktop.&nbsp; Even though I can quickly launch it, I got to select the server from the drop down, and it has a bunch of other machines I&#39;ve connected to but don&#39;t regularly use.&nbsp; And even though it can remember your login info, I want it quicker!</p> <p>I had tried one of the Vista Sidebar gadgets for RDC, but found it kind of disappointing.&nbsp; You just entered the host and hit go, but it didn&#39;t remember a list of hosts at all.&nbsp; Then I saw the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=51dfe06e-2efd-4c00-9784-e896fe5a5a5b&amp;l=1">RDP Quicklauncher</a> gadget and decided to try it out.&nbsp; It works quite well!&nbsp; Has a drop down, select the server, click Connect, and you&#39;re on.&nbsp; Pretty good!&nbsp; Even has a quick option to select to connect to the console session, which is nice when sometimes people tend to forget to log out of the server.</p> <p>Maybe the ultimate would be to spend some time scripting something up in SlickRun.&nbsp; Though to be honest, since switching to Vista, I haven&#39;t even installed SlickRun.&nbsp; The Vista menu works well for most of my common programs.</p>
