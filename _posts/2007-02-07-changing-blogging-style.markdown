<p>To take a page from <a href="http://jasona.net/">Jason&#39;s</a> recent <a href="http://jasona.net/archive/2007/01/08/Resolutions_2C00_-resolutions_2C00_-resolutions_2100_.aspx">change in his blogging philosophy</a>, I think I am going to do the same.&nbsp; Quite often, I usually wait until I have something to post about to post... some genious code thing, grand event, something to write some nice, thorough content on.&nbsp; The problem?&nbsp; Those don&#39;t necessarily come all that often, and when they do, I never have the time to write them!</p> <p>Additionally, in January I fell <em>way</em> behind on my blog reading, and while I&#39;ve been catching up lately, I&#39;ve noticed and interesting trend in the blogs that I do read.&nbsp; I like quick little posts.&nbsp; Even when they aren&#39;t genious, when I see a post by someone who makes short entries, I read it much quicker.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be building CS or waiting while getting the latest code, I&#39;ll switch over to FeedDemon and read a brief entry or two.&nbsp; The people with the long, in-depth posts I fall behind on because I always want to set aside some time to really look at it.&nbsp; Even though the content is great, I don&#39;t get to it as quick.</p> <p>So now, going to focus on little things.&nbsp; Find a cool link?&nbsp; Post it.&nbsp; Snap a cool picture?&nbsp; Put it on the site.</p> <p>I think I also need to revise my list of tags... need to come up with some better ones.</p>
