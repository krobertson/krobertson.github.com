<p>I&#39;m working on coming up with a series of posts to make explaining how to use some of our Single Sign On (SSO)&nbsp;modules in various scenarios.&nbsp; The series will be developer-oriented, so rather than &quot;this is how to configure it to do this&quot;, it will be about how to code around Community Server to handle certain situations with the SSO modules.&nbsp; Example of some of the ones on my list:</p> <ul> <li>How to add additional profile information when a user signs up</li> <li>Common&nbsp;gotchas when using Forms Authentication</li> <li>How to get two sites in different virtual directories to work togther</li> <li>How to get two sites on different subdomains to work together</li> <li>How to handle SSO with an ASP.NET parent application that uses the username field on the Forms auth ticket as a user ID</li></ul> <p>Anything else you would like to see?&nbsp; Let me know!&nbsp; Feel free to let me know of any unique scenarios that pose problems when trying to use the SSO modules, or some simple functionality you&#39;d like to leverage.</p>
