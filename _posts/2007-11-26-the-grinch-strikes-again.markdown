<p>In the past, we&#39;ve always gone to this nice <a href="http://www.lightupxmas.com/">musical Christmas light show</a> up in Sacramento.&nbsp; We had been looking forward to going this year and taking Nick, and also wanted to get Trish&#39;s sister and our nephews to go with us.&nbsp; Their website hadn&#39;t been updated yet with this year&#39;s schedule, so we were curious when they were going to be up.</p> <p>This morning, I finally got an email from their newletter with an update, and unfortunately, they were not going to be doing it this year.&nbsp; A couple of their neighbors didn&#39;t like the traffic congestion it caused, and there was a good amount when we went there, and had threatened them with a lawsuit.</p> <p>Overall, find things like this very disappointing.&nbsp; I mean, it is Christmas, where is the Christmas spirit?&nbsp; Second, it is cool!&nbsp; It is an amazing thing to see.&nbsp; And they do it to raise money for <a href="http://www.foodforfamilies.org/">Food for Families</a>, a local charity.&nbsp; Last year, they raised $15,000.</p> <p>This happened to this house in San Jose that used to do a large light arrangement.&nbsp; Their neighbors petitioned the city to force them to stop.&nbsp; As a result, the next year, they put up a giant Grinch pointing over at their neighbors.</p> <p>The update for the place in Sacramento says they might be looking for commercial space next year to do it at, though it just wouldn&#39;t be the same.&nbsp; Such a shame.</p>
