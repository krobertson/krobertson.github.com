<p>As Rick <a href="http://community.reszler.org/blogs/wizz/archive/2006/10/12/joining-the-telligent-support-team.aspx">announced yesterday</a>, started October 30th, he will be joining the Telligent Support Team!&nbsp; Rick (aka &quot;The Wizard&quot; on the <a href="http://communityserver.org/">CommunityServer.org</a>) is one of the CS MVPs and was previously on the support team for <a href="http://www.aspnix.com/">ASPnix</a>.</p> <p>I am sure ASPnix will miss him, though I think he&#39;ll be a strong asset for Telligent as well.&nbsp; He already has a ton of experience with Community Server through his work on the forums and at ASPnix, especially in regards to running and managing Community Server in a hosted environment.&nbsp; I was very glad to hear he was joining.</p> <p>Please give him your congratulations!</p>
