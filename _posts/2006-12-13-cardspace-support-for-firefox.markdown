title: CardSpace support for FireFox!

<p>Found out today that a <a href="http://cardspace.netfx3.com/">CardSpace</a> module for FireFox has been <a href="http://perpetual-motion.com/">released by Kevin Miller</a>.&nbsp; The previous FireFox module wasn't actually for CardSpace, it is a separate implementation of the same Information Cards spec, but not compatible with the Windows CardSpace metasystem.&nbsp; The new extension actually brings up the CardSpace interface and allows you to use the same cards that are accessible through IE.&nbsp; Very cool!&nbsp; Now I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything by using FireFox 2.0 instead of IE7 (sorry IE).</p> <p>Another cool thing, Garret Serack also post some <a href="http://www.fearthecowboy.com/2006/12/detecting-cardspace-support-including.html">javascript code for detecting CardSpace support in the browser</a>.&nbsp; I had an early version of his snippet, but never got it all wired up correctly for Community Server.&nbsp; Now, I think I'll have to take his latest snippet and update it.</p> <p>[via <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/60689233/CardSpaceInformationCardExtensionForFireFox.aspx">Mr. Hanselman</a>]</p>
