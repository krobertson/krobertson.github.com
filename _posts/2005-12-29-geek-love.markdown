<p>The wife's much anticipated Christmas gift arrived yesterday, and she was sporting it while we had some company over last night for dinner. I think she'd like it if I got a matching <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/generic/31cf/">geek t-shirt</a>, but I don't think that will happen.</p><a href="http://www.qgyen.net/photos/category1062/picture1172.aspx"><img style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; FLOAT: right; PADDING-BOTTOM: 10px; PADDING-TOP: 10px" src="http://www.qgyen.net/photos/images/1172/secondarythumb.aspx" border=0 /></a> 
<p>Although, UPS certainly continues to show how much they care for you packages. The box was quite beat up when it arrived. When the delivery guy dropped it off, I said "WTF happened to this thing?", though he just kind of shrugged and took off. Probably didn't want to claim any responsibility, though I didn't care, its not like it would damage a t-shirt.</p>
<p>Still playing around with the camera, learning about all the different features, and trying to understand exposure.  Kind of getting into this... may pick up a book about the properties of photography.  A lot of different aspects to a photo that you don't really get to play with on a standard point-and-shoot camera.  Unfortunately, a lot of my pictures while playing around with it are pretty bad, since don't quite understand it all, but starting to get it.</p>
