<P>It is official now.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.kevinharder.com/blogs/kevin/archive/2005/05/18/438.aspx">Kevin Harder</A> and <A href="http://blog.danbartels.com/archive/2005/05/19/665.aspx">Dan Bartels</A> are the two newest members to the Telligent family.&nbsp; They have been working on Community Server as a part of the "commit team," where special community members are given access to our source control and bug tracker to partake in the development.&nbsp; And now, they will be joining the fulltime development team who are luck enough to be paid to do what they love.</P>
<P>I give them my own personal congratulations and welcome them onboard.&nbsp; I look forward to working with them and seeing where we all can take Community Server.&nbsp; And perhaps some of the Telligent gang can break them into the other "CS" around here...</P>
