title: Tornados in California?

<p>Ok, maybe not tornados, but funnel clouds.&nbsp; Today, on my way back from lunch with my fiancee, we&rsquo;d noticed some peculiar funnel clouds forming.&nbsp; As we good back, my roommate and one of my other friends were outside checking out the clouds that were forming.</p>
<p>Apparently, a short while earlier one of funnel clouds had actually touched down at this storage shed behind our apartment complex and tore it up fairly good, throwing debris and water around as it crossed the levee.</p>
