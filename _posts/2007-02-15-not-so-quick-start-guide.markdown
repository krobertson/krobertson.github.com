<p>Was downloading a trial version of some software this morning, when a little bit of text on the site caught my eye:</p> <blockquote> <p>Our <em>35-page</em> QuickStart Guide will get you up and going within 15 minutes.</p></blockquote> <p>Few observations... first, if it is 35 pages, does it <em>really</em> qualify as a quick start guide?&nbsp; I mean, those are usually a couple of pages, maybe 5 pages tops.&nbsp; Second, you think I am going to read 35 pages and set up the program in 15 minutes?&nbsp; Maybe spend 30 minutes reading it, and then I&#39;d be able to actually set up the program in 15 minutes.</p>
