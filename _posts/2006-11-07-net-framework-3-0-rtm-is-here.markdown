<p>Yesterday they finally had the .NET Framework 3.0 official release!&nbsp; I have been awaiting the final release for a while now so some sites and CardSpace implementations could be made on the final RTM code.&nbsp; Lately I've also been wanting to look into WPF and how developing for Vista is using WPF vs. standard WinForms (which is a PITA to do Aero support).</p> <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/blogs/news_and_announcements/archive/2006/11/06/.NET-Framework-3.0-has-been-released_2100_.aspx">official posting at NetFx3.com</a>.</p>
