<p>As I am fashionable late in reporting, Telligent recently hired <a href="http://dbvt.com/default.aspx">Dave Burke</a> to be the first Community Server Evangelist.</p>

<p>One of the first things that he has done is to come up with the <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/dailynews/default.aspx">Community Server Daily News</a>.  This will be <em>the</em> place to get your daily taste for what is happening in and around Community Server.  Topics will range from development news, goods put out by community members, sites using CS, tips/tricks, and interesting bits from the forums.</p>

<p>The big news from <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/dailynews/archive/2006/05/12/529946.aspx">today's edition</a> is that Office 2007 Beta2 will support <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joe_friend/archive/2006/05/12/595963.aspx">blogging directly from Word</a> with specific support for Community Server!  Yes, that is right!  Community Server will be listed there right next to Blogger, MSN Spaces, and Sharepoint!  This will definitely be exciting!</p>
