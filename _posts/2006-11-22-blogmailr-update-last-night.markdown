<p>Rob had posted to the <a href="http://www.blogmailr.com/blog/">BlogMailr blog</a> that last night, we pushed out a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blogmailr.com/blog/archive/2006/11/22/blogmailr-updates.aspx">set of updates</a>.</p> <p>The most notable changes include a fix for an issue where only the first attachment would be submitted to a blog, and also some improved error logging.&nbsp; The error logging is geared towards tracking down the two major remaining items we've been working on: posts being submitted multiple times, and issues with adding certain blogs.&nbsp; The error logging will capture more details about what happened and some of the data that was used to help us reproduce and diagnose the problems.</p> <p>We hope to get those nailed down shortly, and then we have some cool new feature enhancements that we're looking to get out there.</p>
