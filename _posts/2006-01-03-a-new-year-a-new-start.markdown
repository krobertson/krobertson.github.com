<p>Figured I would get in my obligatory "happy new year" post.&nbsp; What is there to look forward to in 2006?&nbsp; Well for starters, we are only about a month away from the release is Community Server v2.0, and we will also be releasing Telligent Mail Gateway, the mailing list and blog by email addon for Community Server v2.0.</p>
<p>In terms of what to look forward to from myself, I plan on continuing to stay more active with my blog, being active with photography, and possibly have a few side coding projects coming (one in the works, as hinted at in a previous post).</p>
<p><a href="http://test.qgyen.net/photos/picture1179.aspx"><img src="http://test.qgyen.net/photos/images/1179/thumb.aspx" border=0 /></a>Speaking of photography, on New Years Eve day, it finally stopped raining (for a while), and the wife and I went out for a little walk over by this little reservoir by our place and snapped this picture.&nbsp; Finally starting to be able to take some good pictures.&nbsp; On this one, used a fairly high aperature so the background is blurred while the main subject is in focus.</p>
