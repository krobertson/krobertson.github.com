<p>Since <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2007/02/13/new-cs-2007-build-new-theme.aspx#comments">people seem to have trouble reading</a>, was curious if they could clarify some.&nbsp; I think the font for comments is a little on the small side, so I will probably bump that up.&nbsp; But are the actual posts too small?&nbsp; Would it help if they were a slightly darker font, since right now it is a little light.</p> <p>I&#39;ll see what I can do, though I think I&#39;m surrounded by old people.</p>
