<p>Forgot to mention after <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/03/03/1476.aspx">my post earlier</a> that my two Audiovox SMT5600s are now sale, if anyone is interested.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cingular version, 6 months old, still have box and everything.  Excellent shape, always used screen protectors.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T version, software unlocked.  Calls work with Cingular SIM, but didn't get data to work (thought didn't really try, since I already had the new phone).  Would make a good replacement for someone still on an AT&amp;T plan, or as a spare Smartphone 2003 development platform, or good to have a spare battery.  About to leave, battery dead?  Swap them out and plug the spare phone into the charger while you're gone!  Screen has one minor scratch.  Always used screen protectors, but this one got through the protector a little.</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone is interested, let me know.  Otherwise I'll just put them on Ebay.</p>
