<p>On Friday, Microsoft announced the name change of WinFX to ".NET Framework 3.0" and also changed the name of InfoCard to "Windows Cardspace".  You can find some of the logic behind it in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel the name change to ".NET Framework 3.0" is going to create a lot of confusion.  I was browsing one site this morning of a program that is still being developed in .NET 2.0 and someone posted "C#/ASP.NET 3.0 is already in beta".  The uninformed will create the confusion.  So just be aware that .NET 3.0 = .NET 2.0 + WinFX.  Also, if we end up using Windows Workflow Foundation in Mail Gateway, I can see the requirements items: "Community Server 2.0+, .NET Framework 2.0, .NET Framework 3.0".</p>

<p>Another big thing today related to all of this is the .NET Framework 3.0's official website, <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/">www.netfx3.com</a>.  Ohh, did I mention that the site is running on Community Server v2.1?  Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Personally, I am psyched about <a href="http://wcs.netfx3.com/">Cardspace</a>.  I think there is going to be a lot more coming from Cardspace, from the community, Telligent, and me personally. :)</p>
