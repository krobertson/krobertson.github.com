<p>For a while now I've been using Subversion locally for version control on some of my small projects, but recently realized that I've been using it in a way that many people may not know is possible.&nbsp; I use Subversion without actually having a Subversion server anywhere in sight.&nbsp; How is this possible?&nbsp; Simple!</p> <p>A Subversion repository is merely a set of files that hold all the information about the files, changes, and even users.&nbsp; The Subversion server is merely a gateway between the client and the repository files.&nbsp; If you take out the server and point the client directly the repository files, it will be right at home!</p> <p>Some of the advantages of using Subversion this way are:</p> <ul> <li>No software to install, configure, eat resources, or open any ports!  <li>Flat file based.&nbsp; Want to move your repositories elsewhere?&nbsp; Just move the files!  <li>Can place your repositories on a NAS device, USB drive, even USB memory stick.&nbsp; Since there is no software, the NAS device doesn't have to have a built-in Subversion server or any junk like that.  <li>Wanted them internet accessible.&nbsp; I have my repositories placed on my NAS device, so if I am out and about and need to get an update, I can just VPN into my home router, and then access it on the NAS device as if I was at home on the network.</li></ul> <p>So how can you configure Subversion to work this way?&nbsp; Follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://qgyen.net/blogs/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingSubversionwithoutaSubversionserver_EDD2/svn_1%5B9%5D.png"><img height="91" src="http://qgyen.net/blogs/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingSubversionwithoutaSubversionserver_EDD2/svn_1_thumb%5B7%5D.png" width="120" align="right" border="0"></a>Install TortoiseSVN.&nbsp; It rocks.  <li>Go to a place where you want the repositories to reside.&nbsp; These will not be your live usable files, these will be the files that are a part of the repository file structure.  <li>Create a new empty folder and use the name of the repository you want to create.  <li>Go into the folder, right click, and go to TortoiseSVN -&gt; Create repository here.&nbsp; Choose the Native filesystem.  <li>Go to where you want your live, usable files to be and create a new folder for them.  <li><a href="http://qgyen.net/blogs/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingSubversionwithoutaSubversionserver_EDD2/svn_2%5B5%5D.png"><img height="91" src="http://qgyen.net/blogs/blog/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingSubversionwithoutaSubversionserver_EDD2/svn_2_thumb%5B3%5D.png" width="120" align="right" border="0"></a> Go into the new folder, right click and go to SVN Checkout.&nbsp; The URL of the repository will follow the "file://" pattern.&nbsp; Your base URL is "file:///" (yes, three slashes).&nbsp; From there, you will use your standard file path, leaving out any semi-colons (:) and changing "\" to "/".&nbsp; So if you created a repository at D:\repositories\test, you would use "file:///d/repositories/test".&nbsp; If you created the repository on another system or on a NAS device, where your address would normally be "\\nas-device\repositories\test", you would use "file://///nas-device/repositories/test" (yup, 5 slashes).</li></ol> <p>One important thing to note about using Subversion this way is that there is&nbsp;limited security when working this way.&nbsp; Anyone who has access to the files will be able to get the files and make check-ins.&nbsp; If you wish to limit access, the best way would be through filesystem permissions.&nbsp; Additionally, on a network share or NAS box, you could require user logins to get access to the files.&nbsp; Another thing is that user tracking uses the username of the user on the Windows machine.&nbsp; You can still track who checked in what, but it gets the username automatically, without doing any user authentication on the repository.&nbsp; It will ignore the repositories conf\svnserve.conf and&nbsp;conf\passwd settings.</p> <p>The URLs you enter may not be the clearest, but this is by far the simplest way to get up and going with Subversion for your own personal use.&nbsp; My own repositories are kept on my NAS box, accessible from both my desktop and my laptop, and can even get on it remotely by VPN.&nbsp; All with zero install and configuration.</p>
