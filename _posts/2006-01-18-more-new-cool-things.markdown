<p>The other day, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/">Rob</a> and Donnie, our&nbsp;Accounts Manager,&nbsp;brought our attention to <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/">Lightbox</a>, this nifty little script to add overlaying images to your site.&nbsp; I thought it was pretty cool, so I just had to find a way to add it to Community Server. :)&nbsp; And so, last night I came up with a little library that contains all the necessary components and a CSModule that detects when you use it and automatically load the necessary CSS and Javascript.&nbsp; Click on the picture below to check it out.</p>
<p><a href="http://test.qgyen.net/photos/images/1238/500x333.aspx" rel="lightbox" title="Building at Sacramento State"><img src="http://test.qgyen.net/photos/images/1238/thumb.aspx" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I will package this up and post it once I get a chance.&nbsp; Tomorrow, I am pretty booked up, so perhaps on Friday.</p>
