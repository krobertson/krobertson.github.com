title: The laptop dilemma... 14&quot; or 15&quot;?

<p>After doing some shopping around, I reached the conclusion that a tablet just isn't for me.&nbsp; Tablets are not made by everyone, they are typically a step behind in the technology, and they all seem to be a tablet first, laptop second.&nbsp; Core Duo laptops are the hot thing now, everyone is coming out with them, yet so far, the only thing publicized is the <a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cmod.to?coid=-30603">Toshiba M400</a>, which has not launched too well.</p>
<p>Additionally, I want something that is primarily a laptop.&nbsp; I will mostly use it as a laptop.&nbsp; So my highest criteria is SXGA+ or larger, and screen size.&nbsp; The best you get with SXGA+ on most is a 12.1" screen.&nbsp; The only exception is the 14.1" <a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cmod.to?coid=-29325">Toshiba M4</a>, and it is not Core Duo and there is speculation it will be discontinued soon.</p>
<p>After checking out some laptops in the stores with 12.1" screens, it just felt too small.&nbsp; I need something with enough screen real estate to seriously use it (and most importantly, enjoy using it) for development.&nbsp; Since the typical tablet offering is not what fits my needs, I'm giving up the idea of a tablet.&nbsp; At least for now... perhaps I'll get an Origami/Ultra Mobile PC (we'll see what the deal is&nbsp;on those with tomorrow's news).</p>
<p>So I will end up getting a Dell, since that fits in with our common systems the support people we typically deal with.&nbsp; However, right now, Dell only has 15" and 17" Core Duo laptops.&nbsp; 17" is too big.&nbsp; So, should I jump on the <a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/inspn_6400?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd">Inspiron 6400/e1505</a>&nbsp;or wait for them to come out with the 14" 640m/e1405?&nbsp; I like the specs on the 15" model, especially now since a built in bluetooth module is available (at first, it wasn't).&nbsp; It has a nice 1680x1050 resolution, very nice all around.&nbsp; My only problem with it is the weight.&nbsp; At 6.18lbs with the 6-cell battery (I'd probably get the larger), it is a tad on the heavy side for me.</p>
<p>I am torn as to whether the negative of the added weight is made up for by the larger screen/resolution.&nbsp; I will mostly use it on the desk/table as opposed to in my lap (especially if I do get an Origami).&nbsp; I no longer carry my laptop with my every place I go, all day,&nbsp;like when I was in college, so the weight isn't as important.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?&nbsp; The cost in mobility too high?</p>
