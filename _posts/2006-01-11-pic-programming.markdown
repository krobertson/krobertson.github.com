<p>Earlier today, I was chatting with a fellow Telligenter, <a href="http://photogblogs.com/blogs/jim_martin/default.aspx">Jim Martin</a>, and somehow it came up about programming embedded systems.&nbsp; Anyway, he&rsquo;d given me an idea for&nbsp;a project&nbsp;(as if I need another project), and I dig out and was going through some of my old <a href="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=74">PICmicro</a> circuit stuff.</p>

<p>Back in about 2000, I&rsquo;d gotten into designing circuit boards and some embedded systems programming.&nbsp; My main goal was to design a device for some basic ethernet to RS232 serial communication.&nbsp; It was for my dad&rsquo;s company to use to transmit text from their workstations to these terminals they had out in the shop.&nbsp; I never quite finished it (hey, was only 19), but I had circuit fully designed, just didn&rsquo;t have the software completely done and school was picking back up.&nbsp; Plus, my prototype ethernet circuit board kept breaking since my soldering skills weren&rsquo;t the best (that Crystal LAN chip was a pita to solder and ensure no contacts were swapped).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think I am going to be getting into this little idea Jim gave me, since I think it was a bit over my head.&nbsp; Plus, all my hardware and PIC C compiler are all out of date.&nbsp; Maybe someday though.</p>
