<p>I ran across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdGQsBDSEpk">this YouTube video</a> this morning and couldn&#39;t help but laugh.&nbsp; Short video by the creator of the Ctrl-Alt-Delete shortcut.&nbsp; Couldn&#39;t help but laugh, since Bill Gates doesn&#39;t look too amused when they cut to him.</p>
