The moment everyone has been waiting for... Community Server v2.1 Beta 1 is now <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2006/07/14/Community-Server-2.1_2C00_-Beta-1-Available.aspx">available for download</a>.&nbsp; We&#39;ve also posted Beta 1 builds of the News Gateway, Mail Gateway, and FTP Gateway add-ons in both .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0.&nbsp; So <a href="http://communityserver.org/files/folders/betareleases/default.aspx">download them too</a>.&nbsp; There is also a Beta 1 release of the Security Modules (Windows Authentication, Forms Authentication, and Cookies Authentication), though the only notable change since v2.0 is to Windows Authentication... there is a fix to allow internal trackbacks to work properly (must have CS v2.1 for them to work, the new release won&#39;t completely solve the issue for CS v2.0).
