<p>One site I like to read regularly is <a href="http://www.gullible.info/">Gullible.info</a>, where they post interesting little facts they find as they crawl the internet.&nbsp; Now that my latest&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blogmailr.com/">Telligent project</a> as launched, catching up on a few things and ran across their post on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gullible.info/archive.php?m=2006-11#post657">November 3rd</a>.&nbsp; It had an interesting little factoid that caught my eye:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the CEO of the New York Times, websites like digg.com were directly responsible for profits shrinking five percent each quarter last fiscal year.</p></blockquote> <p>That is an old school view of new competition.&nbsp; Digg is not responsible for their profits shrinking.&nbsp; They are responsible.&nbsp; They are responsible for their own company, and only them.&nbsp; They failed to innovate.&nbsp; They failed to adapt with their audiences' changing interests.</p> <p>The lines between old media and new media are blurring.&nbsp; They still view themselves as though they should have a rightful stronghold.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; Society is not static, it is always changing.&nbsp; Digg represents the new, the Times represents the old.&nbsp; If the old doesn't change with the new, then the old is going to be gone.</p>
