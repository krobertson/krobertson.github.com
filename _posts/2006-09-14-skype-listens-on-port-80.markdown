<p>Last night, I was sitting down to do some casual work on my laptop while watching TV with my wife, when I encountered an interesting problem.&nbsp; I needed to setup a new virtual directory in IIS for the stuff I was working with, and when I opened the IIS admin tool, the Default Web Site was being shown as stopped.&nbsp; I scratched my head and went to try to start it, and it failed.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; I hadn't really changed anything on my laptop in a while, and it was working fine not too long ago.</p> <p>So, I open up the Windows event log and find an entry for it that says it failed to started because something else was bound to port 80.&nbsp; At this point, I flip out.&nbsp; Nothing else <em>should</em> be using port 80.&nbsp; I figured I had some sort of malicious spyware on my system that allowed a backdoor through port 80.</p> <p>I immediately disable the wireless card to cut off all network access.&nbsp; Then I open up a command prompt and run 'netstat -b' and find out that oddly enough, Skype is bound to port 80.&nbsp; I scratch my head like, why the heck is Skype using port 80?&nbsp; I exit Skype, go back to IIS, try to restart the site, and it loads just fine.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Now why?</p> <p align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/79/243272660_897fae1c98.jpg' title='Skype uses port 80?' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/243272660/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/79/243272660_897fae1c98_m.jpg' border='0'></a></p> <p>I re-open Skype and proceed to look through its settings and find that it has an option for "Use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections".&nbsp; Ok, now it makes sense.&nbsp; But then I look at my desktop and it has the same setting enabled, but yet I've never had a problem with Skype using port 80 on my desktop.&nbsp; Both Windows XP Pro SP2, but never happened on my desktop.&nbsp; I had just installed Skype on my laptop last weekend, so that is why it was happening just recently on the laptop, but still, I didn't understand why my laptop and not my desktop.&nbsp; They don't have the same port setting for inbound connections, to there isn't an issue with the firewall.&nbsp; So I don't know.</p> <p>So to other developers out there (or just regular Skype users), beware of Skype taking over your port 80!</p>
