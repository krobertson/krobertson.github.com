<p>&nbsp;I find it interesting that back in September, Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/iphone/2008/09/04/apple-rejecting-applications-based-on-limited-utility/">rejected a &quot;Pull My Finger&quot; application</a>, when a recent application named iFart has had <a href="http://www.joelcomm.com/more_exciting_app_store_news.html">tremendous sales</a>, and was an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/12/29/flatulence-has-never-been-so-profitable-ifarts-success">easy $30k income for Apple</a>.</p>
<p>So Pull My Finger wasn't good enough, but iFart was. &nbsp;And despite both seeming similar, Apple is making money regardless. &nbsp;It sounds like there is no rhyme or reason to App Store approvals. &nbsp;Its kind of discouraging when you're considering doing iPhone development and your work might be considered of &quot;limited utility&quot;.</p>
