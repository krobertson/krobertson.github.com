<p>Pleased to finally release the build of Qgyen.Lightbox for Community Server 2007!&nbsp; Sometimes can be a little slow getting my little modules updated to new releases, so figured I might as well get this one out tonight, as I was just going through and making a few updates to it.</p> <p>Changes in this release include:</p> <ul> <li>Fixed issue with the Flickr module having an error when the URL contained multiple number sets (Flickr will sometimes show URLs with your username, and others with a user identifier)</li> <li>Fixed issue with the Flickr module not linking to the original photo properly if it wasn&#39;t a JPEG</li> <li>Fixed a possible issue where the Gallery Lightbox module could throw a null reference exception</li> <li>Added a feature where you can specify the CSS class for the rendered IMG (I use this so some images will float left/right with some padding around them).&nbsp; See the readme.txt for how to do it.</li></ul> <p><a href="http://qgyen.net/r.ashx?8">Download here</a></p> <p>If you have any issues, then please let me know!</p>
