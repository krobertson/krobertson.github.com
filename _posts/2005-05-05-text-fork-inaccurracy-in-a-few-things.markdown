<p><a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil Haack</a> has recently <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/2953.aspx">announced</a> a fork of .Text called Subtext.&nbsp; I wish him the best of luck, but found a some inaccuracies in his announcing post.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>&ldquo;There is a non-commercial license available, but it requires displaying the telligent logo and restricts usage to non-commercial purposes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is only a half truth.&nbsp; With the non-commercial license, you are required to display the logo somewhere on the page, but you are not restricted to non-commercial purposes.&nbsp; Simply look at the second paragraph of the license:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>&ldquo;Subject to the restrictions below, you may use the Software for any commercial or non-commercial purpose.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">There are restrictions, but they basically consist of the logo being shown and&nbsp;not taking it and calling your own.&nbsp; None of them have anything to do with restricting a business from utilizing the software commercially.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Secondly, his opinion of the targeted market for CS is a little off.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;By virtue of it going commercial, it's being targeted to a different market than your average hobbyist and blogger.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It can be difficult to write software that targets both big and small implementations.&nbsp; Look at .Text.&nbsp; Plenty of people had a difficult time getting it installed, regardless of large/small site.&nbsp; Out of the box, CS 1.0 does lean towards a larger, multi-user implementation, but it can be easily changed over to work for single users.&nbsp; CS 1.1 will be even easier, as&nbsp;many of the items that raised issues have been worked out.&nbsp; All you will need to do is create a default blog, drop in a new url config file, and edit the web.config.&nbsp; Might even be able to find a way to do all of that for you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CS can handle small sites (like mine) all the way to larger ones, like <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">weblogs.asp.net</a>.&nbsp; Much thought and effort is going to be going into getting it easily configurable for either.&nbsp; CS1.1 has been primarily geared towards bug fixes (for performance and stability), but CS1.2 is the one to watch for some new mind blowing things (both glitsy &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s cool&rdquo; down to kick ass core mechanics).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I do wish Phil the best of luck and will probably watch his progress, but naturally, my loyalties are with the software I write, and you may tend to correct someone when they are a little wrong.</p>
