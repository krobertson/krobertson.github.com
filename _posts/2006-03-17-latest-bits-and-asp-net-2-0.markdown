title: Latest bits and ASP.NET 2.0

<p>Yesterday, I updated my site to use the latest bits of Community Server v2.1, and also switched it over to run under ASP.NET 2.0.  There isn't really anything new in CS v2.1 yet... the only notable thing is the addition of tagging (which is still in the works).  Though it is shaping up pretty nice (my skin doesn't take full advantage of it yet).</p>

<p>CS under ASP.NET 2.0 is pretty nice though.  It is very fast and responsive... noticed it almost immediately.  Want to improve the performance of your site?  Update it to ASP.NET 2.0... you won't regret it.</p>

<p>Now the next thing... should I update my server to SQL Server 2005?  Don't know if there would really be any performance gain from switching over... though maybe I could finally get a better maintenance plan that actually works right.</p>
