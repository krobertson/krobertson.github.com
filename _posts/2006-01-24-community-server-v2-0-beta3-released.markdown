<p>Today, Community Server v2.0 beta3 was released (<a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/thread/511219.aspx">see announcement</a>).&nbsp; Please check it out!&nbsp; If all goes well with this release, we should be entering the release candidate phase soon!</p>
<p>Already had some people asking about some of the extensions I&rsquo;ve written lately.&nbsp; Those will be coming once I release the add-ons I manage, like the NNTP Server, FTP Server, and Security Modules.&nbsp; The beta3 builds of those will be coming out tomorrow.&nbsp; Then I can package up some of my own stuff.&nbsp; The single blog/gallery URL mapping stuff may need a little bit more work, since I have noticed some tricky conditions where it will get a false positive, so I need to setup a better local test site and figure out what is going on.</p>
