<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/qgyen/413884882/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/413884882_519bbe59d6_m.jpg" width="240" height="74" alt="Kind of spam stats I like to see" class="floatleft" border="0" /></a><p>Here is a screenshot for earlier last week of the daily stats from my hardware-based spam filter.&nbsp; I started using a specialized spam filtering appliance about a week and a half ago and I&#39;m loving it so far.&nbsp; The one I am using is by <a href="http://www.ironport.com/">Ironport</a> (and is strangely never mentioned on their site).&nbsp; I just have the basic entry level filter, which is similar to offerings by other companies like Mail Foundry and&nbsp;Barracuda.&nbsp; Out of some of the reviews I&#39;d seen, the Ironport was rated among the highest for best success rate and lowest number of false positives.</p> <p>Overall, I have been very impressed with Ironport&#39;s filtering.&nbsp; Their SenderBase is a reputation based filter that blocks the messages at the connection level.&nbsp; Basically, it checks out the host that is connecting to it and if it is one that is often reported as sending spam, it will tell it up front &quot;I don&#39;t want your message&quot; and close the connection before it has a chance to do anything.</p> <p>So far, I have had no spam messages get though.&nbsp; I have received a few spam messages, though a quick look at the headers and they went directly to my mail server, either from an old DNS cache or just probing the server (ie, it doesn&#39;t follow my DNS MX settings, just sees mail.domain.com and connects to it).&nbsp; And even better, I have not had any false positives, or messages that aren&#39;t spam get marked as spam.&nbsp; Also, some newsletters I had subscribed to now come through instead of getting marked as spam.&nbsp; Often times with those, can easily unsubscribe.&nbsp; Those messages frequently look like spam to other filters, but aren&#39;t necessarily as it is something you signed up for.&nbsp; And unsubscribing is usually easy.</p> <p>My main disappointment with the filter so far is its quarantine functionality.&nbsp; Here is a brief synopsis of what I don&#39;t like:</p> <ul> <li>Doesn&#39;t support aliases.&nbsp; Have two or more email addresses going to the same physical email account?&nbsp; Too bad, you&#39;ll get multiple quarantine notifications.</li> <li>It sends quarantine notices to anyone it accepts messages from.&nbsp; This is a problem when you just tell it to receive &quot;qgyen.net&quot; and don&#39;t narrow it down to just the individual addresses, since adding every address would be a PITA.&nbsp; But this becomes a problem because every morning, the ones to non-existent address bounce back to my mailbox.&nbsp; Some point soon, I&#39;ll get it switch over to validate against LDAP so I can only accept valid addresses and not have to manually add all of them.</li> <li>No way to customize the colors... they let you upload your own title header, but then your colors could easily clash and it would look ugly.</li> <li>No quick link in the notification emails to just delete all.</li> <li>No way to have per-user whitelists.</li></ul> <p>They do sell a device specifically for the purpose of being a quarantine, but it is primarily to be a centralized quarantine when you have multiple filtering devices.&nbsp; I hope it doesn&#39;t have some of these features, while their normal spam appliances don&#39;t.&nbsp; I doubt they&#39;ll ever hear &quot;I want to change the colors on the quarantine, I&#39;ll buy your quarantine appliance&quot;.&nbsp; No, none of the things I mentioned would be good up-selling points.&nbsp; Only reason to get their quarantine appliance is in a multi-server environment, then it is a given.</p> <p>Overall, aside from some of the lacking features in the quarantine, I like the Ironport filter and it has so far been extremely reliable.</p>
