<p>In response to my <a href="http://test.qgyen.net/archive/2006/01/11/1204.aspx">previous post</a> about recommendations for MCAD programs, I've decided to hold off until the .NET 2.0 courses are out.&nbsp; I'd talked to some places that offer courses, and they weren't very certain when they were coming out&nbsp;or how the upgrade courses would be (3 days, one week, etc).&nbsp; So, in the interest of saving time and money, I will wait until the 2.0 courses are out.</p>
<p>Also, I will probably just do the study-at-home programs.&nbsp; I will likely do the "cram" ones, since even some of those are still 600 pages.&nbsp; While I know it is better to know the framework than to know how to take the test, I don't need to know <em>everything</em> for the tests, nor would I actually retain all of it.</p>
<p>I appreciate the comments that I could pass it cake, and I probably could, but I don't want to assume I would and go in unprepared.&nbsp; Sure, I&nbsp;probably&nbsp;have the experience, but I don't always retain all the knowledge I get.&nbsp; All the time, I have to look things up again.&nbsp; In my opinion, the key to a good developer is not knowing everything off the top of their head, but to know how to quickly find things and apply them to their situation.&nbsp; The&nbsp;framework documentation&nbsp;and Google are my best friends.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I wouldn't have those on the tests, so I'd need to brush up on the types of things the tests would ask about.</p>
