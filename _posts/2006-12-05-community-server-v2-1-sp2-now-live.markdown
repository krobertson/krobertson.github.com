<p>Today, SP2 for Community Server v2.1 was posted (<a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2006/12/05/community-server-2-1-service-pack-2.aspx">announcement on communityserver.org</a>).&nbsp; This is mostly an update for a collection of bugs and issues that have been found since SP1, but it does also include the MetaWeblog API update to support newMediaObject that we had previously released.&nbsp; Definitely check it out if you've experienced any of the issues on the list of changes.</p>
