<p>This is something that occurred to me the other day...</p> <p>RSS is becoming pretty big.&nbsp; There is RSS capabilities built into Vista.&nbsp; You can get RSS feeds for sports scores.&nbsp; CNN has RSS on news feeds.&nbsp; On Craigslist, you can do a search and get an RSS feed for the results.&nbsp; There are even sites where you can subscribe to an RSS feed for UPS package tracking.</p> <p>So why does my bank not have an RSS feed?</p> <p>I use Microsoft Money to daily download new transactions from my bank.&nbsp; It works great.&nbsp; But it isn't supported everywhere.&nbsp; Wells Fargo supports it, but not Washington Mutual.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because of all the licensing bull.&nbsp; The means by which they synchronize is totally proprietary.&nbsp; Money has its way, Quicken has its own way.&nbsp; Some banks support both, some support one and not the other, and others support them but not everywhere (like BofA, which supports Money everywhere <em>but</em> CA and two other states).</p> <p>Why does it have to be so arcane?&nbsp; RSS is free!&nbsp; It is cropping up everywhere!&nbsp; It would not take a rocket scientist to implement it!&nbsp; Then everyone can enjoy it!&nbsp; Would no longer need to charge users $6/month to cover the ridiculous licensing fees.&nbsp; If you don't want the extra bloat/baggage of Money/Quicken, you could subscribe to it in your RSS reader and be able to easily check new transactions each day.&nbsp; It would be wondrous.</p> <p>Or take a service like <a href="http://corporate.yodlee.com/">Yodlee</a>.&nbsp; With Yodlee, you can create an account and set it up to link up with all your bank accounts to get a central list of new transactions.&nbsp; It is used by a lot of companies.&nbsp; When Microsoft Money can't connect directly to your bank, it often supports WebConnect through MSN Money, which uses Yodlee.&nbsp; Why can't Yodlee support RSS?&nbsp; If they had RSS support, you could monitor all your bank accounts, regardless of whether or not your individual banks supported it.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be beautiful?</p> <p>Will it ever happen?&nbsp; Maybe I should bug <a href="http://hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> about it.&nbsp; And now that I check his site (after writing this), I see a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AccessingPrivateAndAuthenticatedFeedsWhyItsImportant.aspx">post of his</a> from Monday&nbsp;I hadn't read yet that&nbsp;looks surprising close to this.&nbsp; He also hints on a CardSpace implementation I'd love to see... managed cards from VISA, MasterCard, or AMEX (actually using a mock-up of that idea in my <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/09/13/Official-posting-of-my-CardSpace-presentation-at-Sac-.NET-User-Group.aspx">CardSpace presentation</a>).</p>
