<p>Anyone know of any to get Vista to stop changing my directory views?&nbsp; It seems to love to turn a directory that just contains other directories into the Gallery type view.&nbsp; Then when I change the view back to Details, the columns it shows are Name, Date taken, Tags, Size, and Rating.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; This directory never contained any photos or videos.&nbsp; In this case, it is my folder for various Subversion repositories.</p> <p>Vista always seems to do this and it is annoying.&nbsp; Overall, my experience with Vista has been good, though it has some annoying pet peeves like this.</p> <p>Anyone know how to keep Vista from doing this?</p>
