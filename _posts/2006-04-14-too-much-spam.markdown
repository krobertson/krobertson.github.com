<p>Thinking of dumping my qgyen.net domain name... I've been using this domain name since like '98 or '99 (I forget which), so it would be hard to let it go, but after all that time of handing out my email address to who knows how many sites.  On my new hosting, around 250 messages slip through the built in spam filter per day.  Most then get caught by Outlook's Junk Mail filtering, but not before playing the new mail sound and showing the new folder icon on my taskbar.</p>

<p>Plus there is the issue of difficulty when I give out my personal email address or my website... "what is qgyen?  how do you spell it?"</p>

<p>But then the question is... what would I change it to?  Not easy coming up with a catch domain name that isn't already registered.</p>
