<p>Ohh yeah, one of the main things I love about this time of the year is Starbuck&#39;s holiday drinks, including their eggnog and gingerbread lattes.</p> <p>In store, I was told they weren&#39;t going to have them until November 8th, but I think that was when they&#39;re officially offering them, with signage and all.&nbsp; Luckily, my sister works at a Starbucks down in Fullerton (by LA) and she had told me that her store was supposed to have all the stuff for them on November 2nd.</p> <p>So this morning I figured it&#39;d be worth a shot, so I went in and asked if they had them yet, and sure enough the barista said they do!&nbsp; Now I am enjoying my first taste of the holiday season with my venti no whip extra hot eggnog latte.</p>
