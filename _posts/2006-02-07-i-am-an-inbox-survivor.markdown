<p>Yes, but a short time ago, I was nearly buried alive by my own inbox.&nbsp; Over a span of about 45 days, my inbox went from zero (from the last time I&rsquo;d just transfered it to my archive without sorting) to 1500 messages, all unsorted.&nbsp; It had gotten out of hand, and there was no hope of taking control of it on my own.&nbsp; Until <a href="http://jasona.net/">a friend</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.clearcontext.com/">ClearContext</a>.&nbsp; It is based on the ideas behind <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a>&nbsp;and has helped me to get and keep my inbox at a nice daily average of about 10 messages.&nbsp; Definitely a very very useful piece of software!</p>
