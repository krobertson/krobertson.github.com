title: Qgyen.Lightbox v1.0.60126 - Lightbox implementation for Community Server

<p>As I had <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/01/23/1251.aspx">posted about</a> earlier in the week, I&rsquo;d written a CSModule implementation of the <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/">Lightbox JS</a> image overlay scripts for Community Server.&nbsp; <a href="http://scottwater.com/default.aspx">Scott</a> had posted a binary with all of the modules entered into the little weekend competition on CommunityServer.org, but I thought I would go ahead and release it on its own, along with the source.&nbsp; It includes both the standard Lightbox module (functions exactly the same as the original), and the Gallery specific module easily including a thumbnail of the image in the post.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="http://qgyen.net/files/6/downloads/entry1288.aspx">download it</a> and check it out.&nbsp; I will probably put more documentation on my site once I have the time (one more release to get done), but the zip includes setup instructions, and you can check out the doc online in our <a href="http://developer.communityserver.org/default.aspx/CS.LightBoxModules">Developer Wiki</a>.</p>
