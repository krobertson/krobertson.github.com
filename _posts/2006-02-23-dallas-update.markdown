<p>Hanging around in Dallas, going out to the&nbsp;CS Launch Party tonight.&nbsp; It is mainly just everyone at Telligent going out to dinner, talking about coding, and making fun of (expletive deleted) and (expletive deleted).</p>
<p>It has been quite interesting though.&nbsp; Planning for CS v3.0 and already have a ton of things we want to do.</p>
<p>Been snapping a couple of pictures, but unfortunately taking shots in RAW and don't have anything to convert them here.&nbsp; Ohh well.&nbsp; Maybe switch to JPEG for a bit.</p>
<p>One problem is that <a href="http://www.danbartels.com/">Dan</a> has gotten me all interested tablet PCs.&nbsp; I have some books on tablets at home, but haven't done much with them.&nbsp; Now, I may actually look into getting one.&nbsp; Especially since I am feeling the shortcomings of my current laptop... I can't run Outlook, 4 IE windows, SQL Server 2005, and 3 Visual Studio sessions?</p>
