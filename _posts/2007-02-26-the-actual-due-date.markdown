<p>Last week, we finally had a doctors appointment in which we actually got a due date.&nbsp; Our doctor doesn&#39;t like to give a due date without seeing the embryo, since he measures it to calculate the due date.&nbsp; Before, we weren&#39;t able to see it at all since Trish found out she was pregnant so early.&nbsp; On Friday, we were finally able to see it and get our due date.</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/qgyen/401185039/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/401185039_dc56bf3ff8_t.jpg" width="100" height="74" alt="Our baby at 6 weeks" border="0" class="floatleft" /></a><p>Currently, Trish is at six weeks.&nbsp; At this point, the embryo is about 9mm.&nbsp; It is quite interesting to see, since even though it is only the size of like a green pea, you can faintly see the heart beating.&nbsp; It is a little area that changes color as it beats.</p> <p>So with her being at six weeks, out due date came out to be <strong>October 15th, 2007</strong>.&nbsp; Interestingly, that is the day after my mom&#39;s birthday.&nbsp; So it <em>may</em> actually come on the 14th.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; Now that we have the due date, I think I need to start taking bets on the actual date.</p>
