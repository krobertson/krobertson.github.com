<p><a href="http://www.qgyen.net/photos/images/1183/original.aspx"><img style="FLOAT: right" src="http://www.qgyen.net/photos/images/1183/400x267.aspx" /></a>Windows Media Center seems to get a little confused about what it has scheduled to be recorded sometimes.&nbsp; Take for instance this little snapshot from tonight.&nbsp; Not at the top that it is setup to record every time "Law &amp; Order" is on, yet over the next couple of days, it lists "Late Night with Conan O'Brien".&nbsp; MCE has done this in the past too, and I have to cancel the series for Law &amp; Order, then set it up again, but inevitably, it does it again.&nbsp; It has done this with other shows too.&nbsp; Like mistakenly recording "Starting Over" when I have it setup to record "Stargate SG-1".</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; Any sort of solution?&nbsp; This and a couple other nuances about MCE are starting to get to me and I'd like to get them resolved so I can get back to happy TV viewing.</p>
