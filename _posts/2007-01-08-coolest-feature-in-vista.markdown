<p>Being able to mute and control the sound volume on individual programs... absolutely awesome.&nbsp; So many times, I&#39;ve wanted this type of functionality.</p> <p>It can be quite useful.&nbsp; For instance, over the weekend, I was playing a video game that didn&#39;t really need the sound, and wanted to catch up on some podcasts.&nbsp; Just mute the game and leave the rest of the PC normal.</p> <p>Or say you are on Skype and don&#39;t want to go deaf when someone else IM&#39;s you.&nbsp; Then just mute Windows Messenger.</p> <p>For that matter, could mute Messenger when doing a lot of other things.&nbsp; When listening to some music with the volume up, mute Messenger.&nbsp; When playing a video game at night with the headphones on, mute Messenger.</p> <p>Now the one thing I would love to see: a Windows sidebar applet that lists the current applications and lets you quickly mute/unmute them.&nbsp; Right now, have to go to Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, and Adjust system volume.&nbsp; Not hard, but think a sidebar applet would serve nicely.</p>
