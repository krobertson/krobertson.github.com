<p>There were a number of blogs on virtualization that I was reading, though I&#39;ve found myself more and more just not being interested.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Three reasons.</p> <p>First, there just isn&#39;t a lot of information for me.&nbsp; I am not some big player, I don&#39;t have massive SANs (Storage Area Networks) and all this big equipment that a lot of the info is regarding.&nbsp; I use some virtualization software on my server, and I run some workstation virtualization software on my desktop/laptop.&nbsp; The field isn&#39;t like software development where there are all kinds of things for you to readily play with and try.</p> <p>Second, a lot of the blogs are bland.&nbsp; So much of the content is like repetitive press releases.</p> <p>And third, most of all, the virtualization market seems to resemble politics and school yard fights too much.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Between the main players in the &quot;enterprise server virtualization&quot; market, they are always bickering.&nbsp; &quot;We have better benchmarks.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;No, we have better benchmarks, they used the wrong version.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;We are cheaper.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;They are too cheap.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;We are new and cool.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I&#39;m telling my mommy.&quot;&nbsp; The two worst companies in this are <a href="http://www.xensource.com/">XenSource</a>, the &quot;we&#39;re cheap and don&#39;t know why the other guy costs so much but if you use our software (mainly administration software) you&#39;ll see why we&#39;re cheap&quot; company and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>, the &quot;we run faster in an unfair version matchup with the other guy&quot; company.&nbsp; That is all I&#39;ll say about that, since between a few of the webcasts I watched for both and the &quot;benchmarks&quot; they routinely publish going back and forth,&nbsp;it just gets old.</p> <p>I was into blogs about the virtualization market at first, as would read some stuff on configuring the software and I&#39;d tried out various programs, and they have good content, but not regular good content.</p> <p>Though the one virtualization bit I&#39;m looking forward to more about is Microsoft&#39;s Viridian hypervisor.&nbsp; Forget Virtual Server 2005 R2 SPwhatever, it is pigeon poop compared to what the virtualization software at the hypervisor can do.&nbsp; Microsoft will hopefully be an interesting player.</p>
