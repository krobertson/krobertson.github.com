title: Microsoft Money online service expiration?

<p>Lately I&#39;ve still been using Microsoft Money 2007, however I had never installed their stupid internet update patch and I&#39;d noticed some issues lately with not being able to download updates.&nbsp; I figured they were phasing out the old service, so I would need to finally install the updates.</p> <p>Then I was searching online to find their instructions for installing the updates and ran across their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/fi/osp.mspx">Online Service Policy</a>, which states:</p> <blockquote> <p>MicrosoftÂ® Money 2007 includes up to two (2) years of Online Services. You will be able to use the Online Services in Microsoft Money 2007 for <strong>a period of two (2) years from activation</strong> of the product or until September 1, 2009, whichever is earlier. After expiration, if you elect not to upgrade to the then-current version of Microsoft Money after the Online Services period ends, <strong>you will not be able to automatically update your accounts</strong> and investment values in Microsoft Money 2007.</p></blockquote> <p>Now that nuts.&nbsp; I know they had phased out some of the earlier versions, but it never really hit me that they&#39;d be phasing out my version, or that it was actually already planned and enforced based on my purchase date.&nbsp; So based on this, I can only update my accounts online for about 10 more months?&nbsp; And then I&#39;m cut off unless I do their forced upgrade?&nbsp; That is just ridiculous to me.&nbsp; I have no interest in upgrading at this time, and I don&#39;t really want to have to in the future.&nbsp; Each version of Money gets incrementally <em>worse</em> not better.</p> <p>Goodbye Money, hello <a href="http://www.wesabe.com/">Wesabe</a>, and I mean for good.&nbsp; I am done with Microsoft Money.&nbsp; I don&#39;t care how painful it is, but I am 100% done with MS Money from now on.&nbsp; Tonight, I&#39;ll switch over all my online bill pay from Money to my bank&#39;s website, export all of my accounts, and import them one by one into Wesabe.&nbsp; Then over time, I&#39;ll be sure to get all the transactions named and tagged.</p>
