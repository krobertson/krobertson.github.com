<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">Ryan Whitaker</a> makes <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/RyanW/archive/2006/02/03/437247.aspx">a good point</a>.&nbsp; Why do applications always just assume they can save their crap in my My Documents folder?&nbsp; Sorry, but I like to keep it organised my way and it always frustrates me when some of these folders are just auto created.&nbsp; It is <em>My</em> Documents, not <em>Your</em> Documents!</p>
