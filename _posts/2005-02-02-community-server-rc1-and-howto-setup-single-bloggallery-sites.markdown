<p>Yesterday, Community Server 1.0 RC1 was released.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/">www.communityserver.org</a> for how to download it.&nbsp; RC1 has been working pretty well, with only a few issues, so we are certainly getting closer to the final 1.0 release!&nbsp; Check it out and be sure to stick around for the final 1.0 release.</p>
<p>Also, I <a href="http://www.qgyen.net/blog/articles/cs_howto_single_site.aspx">wrote up an article</a> on how to configure Community Server to work with a single blog/gallery configuration.&nbsp; It uses the same steps I used to configure this site the way it is.</p>
