<p>Next week is going to mark a milestone first occurrance.&nbsp; Next week is the first time I'll be taking a vacation and doing nothing.&nbsp; In the past, whenever I have taken a vacation, it has always been to go somewhere or do something, full of plans, travel, and everything.&nbsp; I've never taken a vacation and just done nothing.&nbsp; Stay at home, sleep in, play Xbox, catch up on little projects, stay hidden on IM.&nbsp; Yes, it sounds great!</p> <p>Though the one problem with my work and a do nothing vacation is that I can only hold out so long.&nbsp; Take a developer who loves to code and is passionate about their projects, then tell them they can't work on them for a week.&nbsp; Torture!&nbsp; I know I'll likely end up doing some work here and there, but the nice thing is that it is at a casual pace, and I could mess around with the things I wouldn't normally have time to get to (like maybe update my blog to CS 3.0 and a new skin).</p>
