<p>A while ago, I traded up from my XV6700 to a <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/11/07/The-new-Q.aspx">Motorola Q</a> as a result of some of the charactistics of the 6700.&nbsp; After using the Q for a short while now, beginning to wonder if it actually is any better.&nbsp; Here are some of my complains with it:</p> <ul> <li>It doesn't autodetect when my bluetooth headset is around.&nbsp; If I go away and come back, I have to manually go into the Bluetooth Manager and reconnect.  <li>Battery life with the standard battery sucks.  <li>Often times, when I am on the phone for a long period of time, the display and keypad will essentially stop responding.&nbsp; The phone will be working, but I can't get the display on, can't hang up, can't do anything.&nbsp; Have to pull the battery and restart it.  <li>Often times, the phone will just die on me.&nbsp; I will go to check email or something and the phone will be off.&nbsp; And pressing the power button to turn it on doesn't work.&nbsp; I have to pop out the battery, put it back in, and then power it on.&nbsp; It is starting to do it more often.&nbsp; I don't know if it isn't holding a charge or what, but it shows it as charged, and often does it when it has only been off the charger for a short time.</li></ul> <p>Perhaps it is just time to get a Blackberry.</p>
