<p>After <a href="http://qgyen.net/life/finding-a-new-domain-is-so-hard/">my post yesterday</a>, I think I came up with a domain name that I like: <a href="http://invalidlogic.com">invalidlogic.com</a></p>
<p>You got to look at it as a bit of a play on words. &nbsp;It could be invalid logic, or the way I have the title, In Valid Logic.</p>
<p>I think I'll stick with it. &nbsp;Better than some of the other ones I was considering. &nbsp;At any rate, hop on over to the <a href="http://invalidlogic.com">new site</a>, and don't forget to update <a href="http://invalidlogic.com/feed">your subscription</a>!</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">As of now, I will no longer be blogging on qgyen.net. &nbsp;It has been a good run.</span></p>
<p>All my old content will remain live though.</p>
