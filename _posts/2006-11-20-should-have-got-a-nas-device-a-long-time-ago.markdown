<p>Last week, my new Network Attached Storage device (NAS, for short) finally arrived.&nbsp; I got the diskless version of the <a href="http://infrant.com/products/products_details.php?name=ReadyNAS%20NV">Infrant ReadyNAS NV</a>.&nbsp; Let me tell you, I should have gotten one of these a long time ago.&nbsp; It is beautiful.</p> <p>I had been going back and forth for a while as far as what I should do for my storage needs.&nbsp; My old RAID card was not going to have Vista drivers (it may for Longhorn Server, but not Vista itself as of yet).&nbsp; What I was after was:</p> <ul> <li>Expandable storage... didn't want to be limited to X sizes, or need to purchase some big monolithic thing  <li>Redundancy... I have stuff I don't want to lose.&nbsp; I don't want something like a HD failure to screw me, no matter how reliable the disks are supposed to be.&nbsp; Will never get 100%, but RAID helps against the single point of failure possibility.  <li>Shareable... my wife is always downloading music, wanting the music I already had, asking where some photos were, etc.  <li>Didn't want a dependence on a single system.&nbsp; If I was sharing music, didn't want to have to have my PC on for my wife to use them.&nbsp; Didn't want files to be inaccessible when I'm monkeying around with the systems, such as when the MP3s were inaccessible when I was toying around with Vista RC1 on my media center PC.</li></ul> <p>When I was trying out Vista RC2, I had moved my RAID card and drives over to my virtual machine server, though found that to be more of a pain than a convenience.&nbsp; I don't keep the VM server on all the time, since I don't need it all the time.&nbsp; It adds to extra heat, noise, and power consumption, so I only turn it on when I need it.&nbsp; Though it takes a few minutes to boot up and be all ready, so if I just needed to reference some project document from a few months ago, it would be a pain.</p> <p>Now with the NAS, I just access it over the network, and its all in a little box that sits behind my monitors on my desk.&nbsp; The Infrant is especially nice.&nbsp; Uses X-RAID, so the arrays are expandable.&nbsp; It has a nice web interface, plenty of security options, FTP and web accessible, full monitoring (it will even email me if a drive gets too hot).</p>
