title: SubSonic + ReSharper?

<p>Anyone have any pointers for using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/actionpack">SubSonic</a>&nbsp;in conjunction with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>?&nbsp; SubSonic looks superb, but ReSharper&#39;s intellisense and syntax highlighting is giving it absolutely no love.&nbsp; Right now, just using a basic website project, and I&#39;ve tried configuring it as a Web Application Project, but doesn&#39;t seem to like it at all.&nbsp; Even upgraded to the latest ReSharper 3.0 EAP release, but no luck.</p>
