<p>I swear, I have some really bad luck with the previous tenants not updating their addresses when they move.</p> <p>The most recent incident was on last Friday.&nbsp; At around 9:30 in the morning, I get a knock on the door.&nbsp; I answer it to find a Dish Networks installer here to set up my satellite.&nbsp; Turns out the person who used to live here had ordered service, but they had his old address.&nbsp; I am not sure if he gave them the wrong address, or if Dish just used a previous address that they had, but I polite told him you&#39;ve got the wrong person and old address.</p> <p>The more colored incident of address-change issues if from my old apartment.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I ever posted this story.&nbsp; I&#39;d been living there for like a year and a half, and the whole time, I would regularly get mail for them... sometimes bank statements, IRS stuff, personal cards, etc.&nbsp; I sent them back for a while, but eventually gave up and just trashed them.&nbsp; Anyway, one day I get a little package in my mailbox.&nbsp; It is addressed to the old tenants and looks like a package containing a movie.&nbsp; So I take it home, figure what the heck, I&#39;ll get a free movie.&nbsp; I sit down on the couch next to Trish (who was on the Xbox).&nbsp; I proceed to open the package and find two porn DVDs!&nbsp; It was something like Milf Patrol and some latina limos video.&nbsp; I was laughing my heart out, since that is the kind of thing that will be in the back of your mind (&quot;oo, wonder if it is porn&quot;), but never think will actually happen.&nbsp; Well, it happened.&nbsp; Trish was embarassed as hell and couldn&#39;t believe it.&nbsp; The odd thing though... (1) the previous tenant was a woman, (2) after 18 months, it is still sent to the wrong address?&nbsp; I doubt she is still giving out that address, which means they probably had it on file, so she probably ordered from there before.&nbsp; Talk about odd luck...</p> <p>And in case you are wondering, we sent the DVDs back... sickos.</p>
