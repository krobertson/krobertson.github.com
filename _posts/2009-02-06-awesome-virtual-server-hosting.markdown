<p>For a while now, I've run a small virtual server business, hosted on a couple of servers that I own in a local Sacramento datacenter.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm looking for a few additional customers.  I don't actively recruit, however looking to fill some extra capacity I have.</p>

<p>Some information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Windows Server 2008 or any linux distro available.</li>
	<li>Virtualization with XenServer 5.</li>
	<li>Low load servers, not oversold or overcommitted.</li>
	<li>Top quality bandwidth.  I don't like crappy connectivity.  Currently get bandwidth through XO and Verizon, soon moving to a new datacenter with Level3 and XO.</li>
	<li>Hardware firewall and hosted anti-spam solution.</li>
	<li>Shared SQL Server 2005 (soon to be moved to 2008) server</li>
	<li>Manage your sites with DotNetPanel, email with SmarterMail</li>
	<li>All servers are Dell PowerEdge 1950s, 2x quad core processors, 8-16gb RAM (upgrading all to 16gb soon)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other important points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your virtual server is your own responsibility.  You break IIS, you fix it!</li>
	<li>No set limits for number of domains/email accounts, but be reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I usually cater to a more technical crowd.  Developers can appreciate the quality, understand they get what they pay for, and are pretty much self-managing.  My current users really don't come to me for that much.</p>

<p>Plans are either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>512mb RAM</li>
	<li>20gb space</li>
	<li>150gb bandwidth</li>
	<li>$50/month for Linux, $70/month for Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>Or,</p>

<ul>
	<li>1024mb RAM</li>
	<li>40gb space</li>
	<li>300gb bandwidth</li>
	<li>$100/month for Linux, $120/month for Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>Space is limited, as I only have a couple servers.  I'm not buying any additional ones, so not going beyond my current capabilities.  Once the space fills up, it is done.</p>

<p>Hosting with me is not right for everyone.  If you need a lot of support, then it may be better to look elsewhere.  I don't run this as a full-on business where I cater to all the customers needs.  That said, if you know what you're doing, want a quality virtual server on quality hardware and connectivity, then I'm just what you're looking for.</p>
