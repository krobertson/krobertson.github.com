<p>Today is my 25th birthday.  I had originally planned on taking the day off, simply to take it easy and get some things done.  Instead of having a nice day off though, been couped up inside, sick.  Started coming down with a cold like Thursday and Friday of last week, then went down to my parent's in San Jose over the weekend and started feeling a bit worse through Sunday.</p>

<p>Not quite what I had planned, though hopefully will be feeling better tomorrow.</p>
