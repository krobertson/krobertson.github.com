What they do is just come up with a new look and feel and expect customers who didn't like it before to come back?

Does that actually work?  It seems to be, if all you have is a new look, and I didn't like your "formula" before, why would I use it now.

Pizza Hut is a good example of true "new and improved".  Their new pizzas are far better than they were before.
