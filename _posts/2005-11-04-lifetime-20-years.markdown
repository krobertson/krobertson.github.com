title: Lifetime = 20 years?

<P>Was listening to the radio today when I went out to lunch, and heard a commercial for Harrah's and Harvey's of Lake Tahoe for some "100 thousand dollars a year for life" promotion.&nbsp; Was just sitting there, semi-paying attention, when they get to the legal fast talking guy.&nbsp; Then something caught my ear... they said that a "lifetime" is defined as 20 years.&nbsp; What the heck?!?</P>
<P>I found it kind of odd, since I know my "lifetime" better not be up in 20 years... I'd only be 44.&nbsp; In most likelihood, the person most likely to win it would be a senior citizen, and 20 years could cover them til the end.&nbsp; Or, since you have to be 21 to enter, they figure in 20 years, they'd be 41, over the hill, and their life is "over" (just kidding).</P>
<P>At any rate, it made me chuckle.</P>
