<p>Earlier, I was reading a recent post on the <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/">Consumerist</a> blog about whether to <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/comcast/ask-the-consumerists-when-moving-is-it-better-to-cancel-cable-234024.php">cancel/move cable service</a> when moving.&nbsp; Since I recently moved, I thought I&#39;d post my experience, as it was contrary to many of the other commenters.</p> <p>To my disappointment, when I go to enter in my comment, I saw that I need to register with the site and sign in to leave a comment.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; As if I really want to register with yet another username and password on yet another site.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to give out my email address again only to open it up to more spam.&nbsp; Seriously, username/password combos suck.&nbsp; All to often, yours is already taken, or you chose a username of some lame nickname that years later you no longer use and are stuck with, or you then forget you&#39;d previously registered and can then no longer remember the password etc etc etc.</p> <p>Honestly, if I just want to leave a comment on a blog, I do not want to have to register and add another username/password to my collection.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t worth it.</p> <p>Hopefully Cardspace can fill the void, but until it gets adoption, just not going to leave comments on those sites.</p>
