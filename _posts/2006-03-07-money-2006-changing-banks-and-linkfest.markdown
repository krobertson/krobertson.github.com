<p>To follow up on <a href="http://test.qgyen.net/archive/2006/01/25/1259.aspx">my post in January</a> about chosing Money or Quicken, I did end up chosing Money.&nbsp; On top of that, I've also changed banks just so I could use online bill pay directly through quicken.&nbsp; Previously, I was with <a href="http://www.wamu.com/">Washington Mutual</a>, and didn't have any problems with them, but they have no direct support for Money (only the WebConnect stuff through MSN).&nbsp; I then opened an account with <a href="http://www.bofa.com">Bank of America</a>, since in looking around, they support downloading and bill pay through Money... but as it turns out, they support it everywhere except three states, one of which is California.&nbsp; So I went back and closed that account, and changed to <a href="http://www.wellsfargo.com">Wells Fargo</a>.&nbsp; So far, I am really digging paying my bills through Money.&nbsp; It is so easy, right there in the software (where I already am when manually paying bills), no need to remember to get stamps, or forgetting to drop them in the mail.&nbsp; Paying bills manually is not a major problem that I needed to make easier, but rather, it was something I don't particularly look forward to and is not a memorable part of my day, so making it simple so I can just get it done is nice.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/default.aspx">Omar Shahine</a> posted about <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/MoneyAndWellsFargo.aspx">his complaints with Money</a>.&nbsp; Sadly, seems so many people seem to cite Money as the "lesser of two evils".&nbsp; Even worse, it is totally true.&nbsp; In many respects, both Quicken and Money suck... the key is Money sucks less.&nbsp; It seems it would be so easy for either one to capture the market if they actually made a good product instead of a less sucky product.&nbsp; As a developer, I'd be hurt if the reason&nbsp;everybody used my software was because it sucked less.&nbsp; I want people to use my software because it&nbsp;is the better of the two.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft should follow <a href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2006/03/googles_secrets.html">Rick Segal's</a> advice and have <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6909078385965257294">Seth Godin's video</a> and <a href="http://www.allmarketersareliars.com/">book</a> be mandatory viewing/reading for all teams.&nbsp; If Money was made to be something consumers wanted to use/talk about, it would be <em>far</em> better.</p>
