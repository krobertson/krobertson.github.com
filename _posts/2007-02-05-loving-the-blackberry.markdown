<p>I am seriously beginning to wonder why I ever used a Smartphone.&nbsp; After just a couple of days and being up and running with my email on my Blackberry, I must say it is mobility heaven.&nbsp; Some of the amazingly simple touches just make it all the more worth it.&nbsp; For example:</p> <ul> <li>I can create my own profiles!&nbsp; Smartphones just have the predefined list.&nbsp; I can even set up emergency numbers that can bypass the profile settings.&nbsp; Cool.</li> <li>Different settings for in the holster and out of the holster... beautiful.&nbsp; It will ring when on my desk, but then vibrate and ring when in the holster on my belt... that way I hear it and feel it vibrating.&nbsp; Often times, I won&#39;t hear the phone if it is a loud place or something like that.</li> <li>The screen automatically lights up when I pull it out of the holster.&nbsp; You mean I don&#39;t need to then press a key to wake it up?</li> <li>Even better, after getting a new message, if I pull the phone out of the holster within a certain amount of time, the screen wakes up AND it automatically goes to the message!&nbsp; Seems so logical... get a new message, if they pull the phone out right away, what are they most likely going to want to do?&nbsp; Read it!</li> <li>The free map application rocks.&nbsp; Used it yesterday since I didn&#39;t remember what street a friends house was off of.</li></ul> <p>Blackberry gets a huge thumbs up.&nbsp; Definitely a convert.&nbsp; I now see why people used to say they should give the Smartphone dev team Blackberrys for a month, and then take them away.</p> <p>The one oddity I haven&#39;t gotten past is that I get duplicate emails sometimes when a message is both to me and a distribution list that I am on.&nbsp; Very common occurrence, since if you email a distribution list, then someone hits reply to all to send it to you and the list, it will happen.&nbsp; I&#39;ll get one message and then another one a minute or two later.&nbsp; Very odd.</p>
