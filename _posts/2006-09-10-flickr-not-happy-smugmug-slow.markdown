<p>For something that I thought would be as simple as taking a screenshot and posting it, it sure can be an ordeal.</p> <p>Was trying to simply take a screenshot with <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.asp">SnagIt</a> and upload it to <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, but apparent Flickr is a little picky on file formats and won't accept any of my files.</p> <p align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/80/239586469_05134b068c.jpg' title='SnagIt/Flickr Problems' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/239586469/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/80/239586469_05134b068c_t.jpg' border='0'></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>I've tried uploading it as a JPG and a PNG, and it simply won't take it.&nbsp; What gives!&nbsp; I already knew that Flickr's "Windows Uploadr" (which is a perpetual beta) was picky on file formats, since it wouldn't accept images that I'd edited and converted, but this is just plain ridiculous.</p> <p>Then, in my frustration, I decided to sign up for a trial of <a href="http://smugmug.com">Smugmug</a> and see if <em>they</em> would accept the file.&nbsp; They did, but the photos didn't show up right away.&nbsp; Ohh no!&nbsp; Instead, they have this process queue.&nbsp; So I got a little image in the gallery saying "Processing Image" and when I look at the Upload Log to see what the heck is going on, it shows that they got it, but under wait time and process time, it just shows "n/a".</p> <p>Finally, the two photos I uploaded show up, after a wait time of 773-778 seconds and a process time of 10-22 seconds.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; I need to wait nearly 15 minutes for the photos to be posted?&nbsp; This is worse than the cache delay in web apps like CS, since at least you can adjust that, or work on getting cache invalidation better, but come on!&nbsp; Is Smugmug "Web 2.0"?</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp; Think Flickr was having some problems, since now it is accepting the images.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; As for Smugmug, another image I'd uploaded another image that had a wait time of 918 minutes (now over 15 mins).&nbsp; Bleh.</p>
