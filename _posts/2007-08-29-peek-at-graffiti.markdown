<p>Last night, the latest edition of <a href="http://telligent.com/blog/">Tellicast</a> was posted, including a <a href="http://telligent.com/blog/archive/sneaking-a-glimpse-of-graffiti.aspx">sneak peak of Graffiti</a>, the new light weight CMS product by Telligent.&nbsp; Graffiti is being geared at small to medium sized business who just simply want to get some content up - whether it be a blog or a whole website.</p> <p>One thing you may ask right off the bat when looking at it is if Graffiti is a new single-blog engine.&nbsp; The answer?&nbsp; Yes, it can be, but no, it isn&#39;t intended to be.&nbsp; As Scott says early in the video, CMS isn&#39;t always a blog, but a blog is pretty much always a form of CMS.&nbsp; So you would be able to easily run a blog off of Graffiti, though it can do quite a bit more.</p> <p>Graffiti played a part in the Telligent <a href="http://telliterns.com/blaken/archive/2007/08/20/graffiti.aspx">Hack-A-Thon</a> that we had a couple of weeks ago while the remote crew was in Dallas.&nbsp; The Tellicast was a snippet of Scott&#39;s presentation of Graffiti, and after his presentation, we were all set loose with the challenge to build the coolest add-on, feature, or do-dad for Graffiti in 18 hours.&nbsp; There were about a dozen or so excellent entries, most of which probably ended up being incorporated as core features.</p> <p>For a quick look at Graffiti, you may notice the new <a href="http://csdc.communityserver.org/">Community Server Developers Conference</a> site includes a footer that say &quot;implemented in Graffiti CMS&quot;.</p>
