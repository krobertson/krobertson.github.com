<p>Earlier today I posted the first article in a <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2007/05/16/community-server-single-sign-on-scenarios.aspx">series I&#39;d previously mentioned</a>.&nbsp; This article is about <a href="http://wiki.communityserver.org/kb/article.aspx/270/common-things-to-check-when-using-forms-authentication/">common issues that people encounter when setting up Forms Authentication</a>.&nbsp; It talks about ensuring ticket names match, setting machine keys, and setting the cookie&#39;s path and domain properly.</p> <p>Also, as I&#39;d previously mentioned, please send me suggestions for future articles if you haven&#39;t already!&nbsp; Over time, I&#39;ll be adding more and more.</p> <p>Over time, these will likely get more technical and involved, though I really wanted to get this first one out there as it is a common question on the forums that people seem to regularly face.</p>
