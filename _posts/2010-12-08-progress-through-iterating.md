It was a little over a year ago that I launched the public beta of Trunks, and when talking with a friend was looking back at all the revisions it has gone though.  Although its only been live a year, I've actually been working on the project for 3 years now and I'm on the 4th major revision of its codebase.

The projects that are most fulfilling long-term are those that you have a vested interest in.  Often times, they're beyond purely financial.  I have never gauged Trunk's success on its profits, rather it is an idea that I myself find value in, and believe others do as well.  That is why I've stuck with it over time.

Each major revision has addressed problem areas of the previous and has gotten incrementally better and more mature.  When looking back, can clearly see the problem points of the previous version and how they were addressed.  It is important to look back to see the path you've traveled.  Be aware of the mistake you've already addressed so as to not re-introduce them.  And if nothing else, feel proud of the investment you've made in the project and you own growth.

I had basically forgotten I'd been working on Trunks for 3 years.  After being reminded, was looking at it and thinking damn, its come a long way.
