 <p>Today, we had our annual Family A&#39;s Game, where we all go, tailgate, and enjoying a good A&#39;s game.  After the game, when we got back to the cars, we saw one of the most interesting vehicles I have ever seen.</p>    <p align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/70/186167032_3d0e6bd05c_b.jpg' title='Super spiffy' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/186167032/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[furcar]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/70/186167032_3d0e6bd05c_t.jpg' border='0'></a> <a href='http://static.flickr.com/45/186167030_4280d550a1_b.jpg' title='Looks like it has whiskers too' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/186167030/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[furcar]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/45/186167030_4280d550a1_t.jpg' border='0'></a><br /> <a href='http://static.flickr.com/1/186167031_2311c4441f_b.jpg' title='Fur car' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/186167031/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[furcar]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/1/186167031_2311c4441f_t.jpg' border='0'></a> <a href='http://static.flickr.com/59/186167029_53f8d4744f_b.jpg' title='You never know what you'll see in CA' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/186167029/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[furcar]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/59/186167029_53f8d4744f_t.jpg' border='0'></a></p>    <p>Yes, a car covered in fur.  You can find all sorts of odd things in California... especially in the Bay Area.  This car is definitely one of a kind.  Not sure what kind of fur it is, though we thought it might have been ostridge or something.  Either way, it kind of smelled like wet dog around the car.</p>    <p>Interestingly enough, we were a small ways behind the car on our way home and the person exited in Berkley... kind of fitting.</p>
