<p>Been a quiet week for posts, but everyone at <a href="http://www.telligent.com">Telligent</a> has been quite busy getting Community Server ready for v2.0 to RTM.  One of the last surprise things we did was to rebrand the <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/">main site</a> for v2.0.  Go and check it out!  It is quite sleek!</p>

<p>This new theme will be distributed with the final RTM version of CS, along with the previous blue default theme.</p>
