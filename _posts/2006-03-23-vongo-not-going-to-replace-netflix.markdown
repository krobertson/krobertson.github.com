<p>A couple of days ago, I decided to give <a href="http://www.vongo.com">Vongo</a> a try.  They are the service that lets you download and view your movies, instead of having to wait for them in the mail with services like <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>.</p>

<p>Pretty much right after I signed up with Vongo, I was ready to cancel, but I paid $9.99, so I figured I'd have to download and watch a couple of movies just so I get my money's worth.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of issues I have with Vongo:</p>

<ul>
<li>Horrible selection.  It is not very big, and mostly older or unheard of movies.</li>
<li>Movies show an expiration date, probably when they are licensed to show it until.  I'd prefer to know I could get movies anytime, not only until 11/06 or something.</li>
<li>Movies are formatted as if they'd be shown on TV.  A little Starz logo pops in the corner from time to time.  You do get widescreen (if available).</li>
<li>No Dolby Digital or any kind of surround sound.  Again, as if it was on the TV on a plain old cable channel.</li>
<li>Interface pretty much sucks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I signed up with Vongo thinking I'd get a nice Netflix replacement where I could just download any of the movies I want, when I want them.  Sorry, not there yet.  I like the idea, but Vongo just misses the mark.  For me to ever reconsider, I'd at least need a much wider selection and the ability to get digital surround sound out of it.</p>
