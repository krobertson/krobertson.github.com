<p>Microsoft released this nifty little <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=df6a6e6e-21af-4786-ad1d-a38e8bfda82f&amp;DisplayLang=en">Soccer Scoreboard</a> application yesterday for you to keep track of the 2006 World Cup.  Pretty nifty little app.  Think I might actually get a little use out of it.  I'm not a big soccer fan, but interested in keeping up on the World Cup.</p>
