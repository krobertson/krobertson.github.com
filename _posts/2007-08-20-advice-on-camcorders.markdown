<p>A while ago before Scott&#39;s wife gave birth, Scott was <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/best-compact-digital-camera/">hunting for a good compact digital camera</a>.&nbsp; Now I find myself in a simular predictament.&nbsp; Trish is due in less than two months now, and while I have the digital camera aspect covered, but what I am needing is a camcorder!&nbsp; Pictures are good, but we will undoubtably want video too.&nbsp; I mean things like it crawling around or smiling, or first steps, etc.</p> <p>The primary thing I want is a digital camcorder.&nbsp; I mean, hello, future geek dad, has to be digital.&nbsp; For media, I don&#39;t care too much.&nbsp; I am a little unsure about DVDs, since while they are ready for use, they aren&#39;t ready for use on the computer, and the media isn&#39;t reusable.&nbsp; MiniDV is nice, but from what I&#39;d seen years ago, to get it off the camcorders and onto the computer, you had to like play the movie back... you couldn&#39;t just drag and drop onto your computer.&nbsp; Ones with a hard drive are nice, but then you are limited to the built in size and can&#39;t just swap to another disc as with DVD/MiniDV.</p> <p>Additionally, it has to be name brand with a good repuation for optics.&nbsp; I don&#39;t need top of the line stuff, but I&#39;d want something that I won&#39;t be looking to replace within a year or two.&nbsp; In general, I am in love with Canon products.&nbsp; But even brand name can vary, since there are so many factors.&nbsp; Most important is probably video quality, focus, and battery life... suppose.</p> <p>Finally, I am somewhat on the rocks as far as whether or not to get HD.&nbsp; HD camcorders are usually more expensive, though I have seen that some like 2006 models are affordable new.&nbsp; Could easily get them online new even though they aren&#39;t the current model year.&nbsp; HD camcorders have been around for a little while, so getting cheaper, and previous model years are even more affordable.&nbsp; The geek part of me is hungry for HD.&nbsp; The geek parent is thinking &quot;don&#39;t you want baby&#39;s first steps in HD?&quot;&nbsp; But the first time parent in me is saying to be practical and to think affordable, since I&#39;ll soon be moving a good poriton of my budget to diapers.</p> <p>Any thoughts or recommendations?</p>
