<p>Lately, it has been interesting as new things blossom in the backyard.&nbsp; Every few days, I&#39;ll go out there and look around, find something new has come into bloom, and then go grab the camera and take a few shots.&nbsp; It makes for a nice 15-20 min afternoon break, and then can mess around with processing the photos some later on.</p> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/218/455012936_37179b5e8c_b.jpg' title='Explosion of white' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/455012936/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[spring]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/218/455012936_37179b5e8c_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/250/455012940_62d728682c_b.jpg' title='IMG_4135' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/455012940/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[spring]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/250/455012940_62d728682c_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/215/447882189_6e92e558b4_b.jpg' title='Ladybug' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/447882189/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[spring]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/215/447882189_6e92e558b4_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/183/449956968_960a950d25_b.jpg' title='Night time flowers on the porch' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/449956968/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[spring]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/183/449956968_960a950d25_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/227/447882183_ea75334248_b.jpg' title='Praying Mantis lawn ornament' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/447882183/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[spring]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/227/447882183_ea75334248_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <p>Also gives me&nbsp;some nice&nbsp;opportunities to play with colors.&nbsp; Those photos were actually from like last week (a bit behind).&nbsp; There have been some new things sprouting I&#39;ll have to take some shots of, perhaps over the weekend.</p>
