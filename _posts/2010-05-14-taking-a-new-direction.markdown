<p>Today is my last day at <a href="http://telligent.com">Telligent</a>.  After almost 6 years at Telligent, I have decided it is time to move on.  I've certainly enjoyed my time and taken pleasure in watching our products mature over that time and working with amazing developers who've definitely helped me grow.</p>

<p>On Monday begins a new chapter though.  I've decided to make the leap from developing in .NET full time to focusing on Ruby and Rails.  On Monday, I join the team at <a href="http://involver.com">Involver</a>, where I'll be building applications for marketers and brands to reach audiences through social media.  I am really looking forward to working on their platform and to get back to face to face time with my coworkers.</p>
