<p>So I got my new layout up and I think I got most of the kinks worked out earlier.&nbsp; Still need to clean up the markup some, since while I was skinning I went back and made some CSS changes that I hadn't accounted for, and deviated from the nice clean markup I originally had on my proof.&nbsp; But, I wanted to update the build on my site, and figured I'd push out the layout then too.</p>
<p>I think I am going to be needing to re-organize my photos section, since I got a ton of pictures on there that don't really need to be.&nbsp; I used to think "ohh, post all your photos, share you life!"&nbsp; But that is just boring.&nbsp; There'd be a lot of bad shots, and just simply no relevance.&nbsp; So think I am going to trim it down, keep it more like a portfolio, with then maybe a random section for stuff I post to my blog.&nbsp; I did add the Files section, since I plan on making more code available.&nbsp; I've been sitting on a couple CS mods I'd written and haven't released.</p>
