<p>Tonight, I went to the <a href="http://www.sacdotnet.org/sacdnug/index.aspx">Sacramento .NET User Group</a> and saw <a href="http://www.mcwtech.com/CS/blogs/keng/">Ken Getz</a> talk on WinForms Tips &amp; Tricks (who coincidentally uses CS, though I didn't get to talk to him afterwards since he had to leave right after it).  Anyway, right after the meeting, they had this raffle for a couple prices and I won myself this nice little shirt:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/qgyen/176786628/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/45/176786628_bf2d5712d3_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Programming is like sex" border="0" align="left" /></a>
"Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life."</p>

<p>I thought my wife would laugh at it, but she wasn't extremely amused.  She was like "our kids aren't going to be mistakes!"  No, of course not, babe.  But it is a funny shirt. :)</p>

<p>And for those of you who are in the Sacramento/Bay Area, you should keep your keep your schedules free for either August 29th or September 26th (likely the August date) as I will be presenting at the Sacramento .NET User Group on Implementing Windows CardSpace, covering what CardSpace is, types of applications, a demonstration of a live site utilizing it, and a walk through of how to implement it in your own applications and sites.  A part of the demonstration will cover CardSpace integration Community Server!  More to come on that in time. :)</p>

These are a hot commodity and I only have a very limited supply.  So if you want one, be sure to come out!</p>
