title: Easy remote desktop?
wordpress_url: /archive/easy-remote-desktop/
---

<p>A while ago, I remember someone blogging about a remote desktop style tool that was very easy for people to use.&nbsp; It was where you went to a website, got a key, and then someone else went to the site and entered in the key.&nbsp; Then you cold get onto their system.</p> <p>Trying to find the site, since my sister has been having some spyware problems and she isn't tech savvy, so walking her through it over the phone is painful.&nbsp; And I won't be seeing her again until late October, so hoping to get some sort of easy remote desktop going so I could take a look at it.</p>
