title: Top Gear back on tonight?

<p>I was quite disappointed when the UK show Top Gear disappeared from Discovery Channel a few months ago.  It was a weekly favorite for me to watch while eating lunch.</p>

<p>Last week, I noticed that once again, Top Gear is on Discovery Channel (2 shows tonight, 1 show tomorrow night), though is this the new <a href="http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2006/01/stories/08/2.html">US version I've heard about</a>?</p>

<p>Quite honestly, I don't think I would like a US version of the show.  Just look at the shot of the hosts... they look like your typical all-American boys.  The problem?  Their favorites will probably be American muscle cars, like the Mustang, Camero, Firebird, and Corvette.  Sorry, but I don't really care for those cars.  I liked the UK show because they showed a lot of very nice foreign cars and the tastes were far more refined.</p>

<p>Have it set to record it tonight... will probably watch it during lunch tomorrow, but if it is the new US version, I'm going to be skeptical.</p>
