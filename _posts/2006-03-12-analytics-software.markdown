<p>Anyone have any recommendations for analytics software?&nbsp; Been checking out different programs for analyzing my IIS log files, but none of them seem to do quite what I want.&nbsp; I'd prefer something web based, using ASP.NET, though can't find anything in that category.&nbsp; So it seems like I am stuck with desktop applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&amp;displaylang=en">LogParser</a>: Uses SQL-like syntax to run queries on your log files.&nbsp; Nice for specialized queries, but more uses command-line.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.surfstats.com/">SurfStats</a>: Nice GUI application, attractive charts, nice queries, but slow at parsin the log files.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mach5.com/">Mach5 Log Analyzer</a>: Processes fast, but the queries aren't always the best and the graphs aren't as attractive.</li></ul>
<p>Anyone have any other suggestions?</p>
