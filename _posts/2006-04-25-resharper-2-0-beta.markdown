<p>Got an email from JetBrains this evening informing me that they've released an <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/beta20.html">official beta</a> of ReSharper 2.0.  I've been using their alpha releases of 2.0 for a while now in both Visual Studio 2003 and 2005.  There have been some bugs, but notice them get processively better with each build.  2.0 is definitely a nice upgade from v1.5.  One of th things I like most is it refreshes its cache of all of the files in the background instead of while the project is loading, slowing down the load time.</p>

<p>If you haven't yet discovered ReSharper, I definitely give it a huge recommendation.  The email mentioned that when v2.0 comes out, the price will be raised from $149 to $199, however if you buy it now, the upgrade is free.  If you already own it, then the upgrade is free as well (yippee!).</p>

<p>They aren't paying me to promote it or anything, but ReSharper is probably the single tool that has etched its way so deeply into my development that I cannot live without it.  I do not know how I used Visual Studio before it.  I rebuild my PC a few weeks ago and had launched Visual Studio before installing ReSharper and it felt so foreign.  Its keyboard shortcuts are just so natural to me now.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you haven't at least tried it, check it out.  Excellent tool, and many uses far beyond its keyboard shortcuts.</p>
