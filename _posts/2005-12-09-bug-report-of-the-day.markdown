<p>Today, we starting beta testing some software with various users and one of the bug reports just made me chuckle.</p>
<p>There are two executeables, one is a Windows service and the other is for a console mode.&nbsp; When firing up the console version, it has a slight spelling error that says "Press any key to exist...".</p>
<p>Couldn't help but chuckle at it.&nbsp; Not a harmful bug or anything, and it is basically one of the really early lines of code that you write and then move on and never look at again... but still, kind of funny.</p>
