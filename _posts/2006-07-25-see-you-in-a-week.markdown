<p>I will be gone for the next week, as it is now my turn to take my vacation.&nbsp; I will be up in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Calumet,+MI&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=47.186679,-88.423805&amp;spn=0.212794,0.543823&amp;om=1">the copper country</a> (as my grandfather used to say) for the next week, hanging out on Lake Superior.</p><p>See you next Tuesday. <br /></p>
