<p>Anyone have any opinions on the best, current antivirus software that has the lowest memory/cpu utilization?</p>

<p>Back in the day, I used to use <a href="http://www.pandasoftware.com/">Panda Antivirus</a>, but then I'd heard some mixed reviews about it not always catching things and decided to move on.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been using <a href="http://www.symantec.com/index.htm">Symantec</a> Antivirus 2004 Corporate and like it a lot.  Seems to have pretty low memory and CPU usage for continual protection, but it is getting older.</p>

<p>Recently got <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/">McAfee</a> Virus Scan Enterprise 8i and put it on my laptop and was bitterly disappointed.  Was reinstalling some things like SourceGear Vault and was noticing it loading the installer and doing the installing rather slow, so I fired up Task Manager and saw McAfee eating up 40-50% of the CPU.  Promptly uninstalled that.</p>

<p>So what is the best antivirus solution nowadays?  I want good protection and I want to never know it is there... so barely any memory usage and hardly any CPU expense to continually process.  If nothing else, I'll just stick with Symantec 2004 for now.</p>
