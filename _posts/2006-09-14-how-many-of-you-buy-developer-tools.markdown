<p>How many of you out there buy developer tools out of your own pocket?&nbsp; Could range from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/">profiler</a> (was checking that out a while ago, pretty cool), or a library like a set of charting tools?&nbsp; Or, do you try to have your employer pick up the tab, if it is for a project at work (*grin*)?</p> <p>Just curious.&nbsp; I&#39;ll buy something myself if it is something that is <em>really</em> useful, that will greatly improve my productivity or that I will regularly use, for work and non-work projects.&nbsp; ReSharper was one of those... it was well worth it and has repaid itself many times.&nbsp; Though I was recently looking for some charting controls just for myself, to generate some little charts for some stuff, but none of the free ones looked that good, and most cost a couple hundred dollars.&nbsp; Perhaps I could just get one with a demo, do what I need, and then dump it.&nbsp; Often times, the libraries aren&#39;t priced for casual developers.&nbsp; Or something like dotTrace, which would be fun to screw around with and fine ways to tweak programs, but I don&#39;t need to spend $250 out of pocket... and it is probably one of the cheaper ones on the market.</p> <p>It seems like a catch-22 though.&nbsp; I love to code all kinds of things, sometimes for no particular reason other than I saw it, it looked cool, and I wanted to write something that used it (talking about a library in this case).&nbsp; But for some cool things, it costs $$ to make use of it, so unless you got money to burn, it doesn&#39;t do much good.</p> <p>Perhaps I should start up a &quot;development fund&quot;... like set aside $10/week to spend on developer tools and libraries.&nbsp; That wouldn&#39;t be too bad.&nbsp; And maybe only get things that I&#39;d continually use, rather than one-offs.</p>
