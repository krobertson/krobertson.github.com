<p>Read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/MJmurphy/archive/2005/03/14/395322.aspx">over here</a> about a <a href="http://www.legostarwarsthevideogame.com/">Lego Star Wars game</a> coming out in April with a downloadable demo.&nbsp; Getting it right now&hellip; should be good entertainment when I need a break at 2&ndash;3am this week<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>: Final week of a project before delivery sucks.</p>
<p><em>Update: It won&rsquo;t install on Windows 2003.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up with that?&nbsp; Hate it when companies do that.&nbsp; Logitech was the same way with my keyboard software, but running it in compatibility mode fixed it.&nbsp; Not this.&nbsp; Grr.</em></p>
