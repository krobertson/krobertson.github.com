<p>Last week, my wife had to take some paperwork up to school, so while she was taking care of that, I decided to stroll around with my camera and take some pictures.</p>
<p>[photo:1242] [photo:1232] [photo:1229]</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="http://test.qgyen.net/photos/category1065.aspx">other pictures</a> to check out.</p>
<p>Also should mention the above images are using another module I made for Community Server using the <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/">Lightbox</a> scripts.&nbsp; It uses a simple CSModule that changes any occurrance of &#91;photo:1234&#93; into showing a thumbnail of the image (1234 being its PostID), with a link to show a larger one in the Lightbox view, and it also has the picture's subject as the caption and a link to view it in the gallery.&nbsp; I won't be posting it until after Community Server v2.0 beta3 is out, since it is now dependant upon it, and we also had a little CSModule competition over the weekend that I entered it in.</p>
