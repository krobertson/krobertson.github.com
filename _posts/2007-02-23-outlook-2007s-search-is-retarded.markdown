title: Outlook 2007's search is retarded

<p>I swear, the search functionality in Outlook 2007 is just plain dumb sometimes.&nbsp; Earlier I was trying to track down a message in my 2006 archives, I knew what folder the message would be in, and I knew some search terms that would definitely bring it up.&nbsp; What happens?&nbsp; No results... not any.&nbsp; So I clear my search, and just to make sure it is working, I see a number of messages from ScottW at the top so I enter in &quot;from:Scott&quot;.&nbsp; That should return all messages from Scott, and since I was in my 2006 Community Server folder, there should be plenty.&nbsp; But it shows no records.&nbsp; What the hell!&nbsp; There are some right there at the top!&nbsp; There should be like a couple hundred in the folder overall!</p> <p>LookOut, the old search plug-in for Outlook 2003, was the absolute best.&nbsp; It was bought up by Microsoft a few years ago, but unfortunately, all their email search functionality <em>sucks</em>.</p>
