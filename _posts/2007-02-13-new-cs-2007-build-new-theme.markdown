<p>Finally updated to a new build, since my last one was right after the new year.&nbsp; There have been a number of improvements and fixes since then.&nbsp; Now that we are gradually approaching beta, we have been getting pretty damn stable.&nbsp; This will surely be one solid beta.</p> <p>To go along with the new build, decided to whip up a new theme.&nbsp; This one is based on a design called <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/information/id/3557">TerraFirma</a> by <a href="http://www.nodethirtythree.com/">NodeThirtyThree</a>, available from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oswd.org/">OSWD</a>.&nbsp; I&#39;d have to say, this is my favorite theme I&#39;ve put together yet.</p> <p>Once we release Beta1, I will be sure to release my previous skin (BitterSweet), and will release this skin as well.&nbsp; Will probably try to come up with some more from time to time.&nbsp; This one took me about 2-3 hours while waiting for Trish to come home and watching TV.</p>
