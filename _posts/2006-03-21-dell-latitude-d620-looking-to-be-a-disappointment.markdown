<p>One of the new laptops I was waiting for, the Dell Latitude D620, is looking like it will be a disappointment.  <a href="http://www.coreduonews.com">CoreDuoNews.com</a> posted some leaked information from a review that was prematurely released (and <a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:cE2so67Yfw0J:laptopmag.com/Review/Dell-Latitude-D620.htm+Dell-Latitude-D620&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1">cached by Google</a>).</p>

<p>According to the article, it will have a 14.1" screen (what I was looking for), but the upgraded screen is only going to offer 1440x900 resolution.  What is it with the migration to widescreen displays on all of these laptops?  Sorry, I don't want a widescreen.  Sorry, I don't want less screen real estate.  I like my square (or, mostly square) screen and I like 1400x1050.</p>
