<p>Was reading <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg7/TheDailyGrind1016.aspx">this morning's Daily Grind</a>, which has a link to <a href="http://www.pcnames.com/">PCNames</a>, an&nbsp;AJAX enabled domain search sites.&nbsp; It is very cool... definitely my site for checking domain availability.&nbsp; Far better than dealing with the horrid UIs of GoDaddy or any of other registrars.&nbsp; Be sure to check it out!</p>
