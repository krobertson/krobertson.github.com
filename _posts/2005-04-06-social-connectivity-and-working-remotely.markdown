<P>In Dallas for the rest of week, meeting with the <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/">h</A><A href="http://www.jasona.net/">e</A><A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottdockendorf/">a</A><A href="http://www.scottwater.com/">d</A> <A href="http://www.codeblooded.com/blog">h</A><A href="http://www.callmealex.com/">o</A><A href="http://www.jamesdmartin.com/">n</A><A href="http://www.mcglumphy.com/blogs/">c</A><A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ericjsmith/">hos</A> from <A href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/">work</A>.&nbsp; After two years of working with <A href="http://www.jasona.net/">Jason</A> on nGallery and at Telligent, I only now have finally met him face to face.</P>
