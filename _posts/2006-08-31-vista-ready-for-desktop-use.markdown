<p>With the August CTP of Vista now released and on MSDN, anyone have any feedback on whether it is actually ready for use?&nbsp; I know <a href="http://blog.danbartels.com/">Dan</a> has been using it on his laptop and had some assorted issues, though curious if I should give it a shot on my desktop.&nbsp; I know there is no upgrade path to future versions, so that is kind of a deterant.&nbsp; Though I do use Acronis TrueImage, so I could easily switch back to another drive image with XP.</p> <p>I've been using the July CTP on my Media Center PC, and it has been running pretty smooth.&nbsp; Few hiccups here and there, but nothing too major.&nbsp; Don't want to mess with it though, since new seasons are starting next week, and I don't want to miss them.</p> <p>Or, perhaps I should hold off until they get the driver situation figured out... don't believe I saw any drivers for my RAID card, and remember issues with my integrated sound card.&nbsp; Then again, I think the main issue was I was trying it out on a x64 system before.</p>
