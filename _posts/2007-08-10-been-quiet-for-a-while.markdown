<p>The other day I was looking at my blog and realized it had been over two months since I posted!&nbsp; Hadn&#39;t realized it had been so long!</p> <p>Going to be trying to get back in the swing of things and get posting.&nbsp; Hasn&#39;t really been a shortage of things to write about, since I&#39;d definitely had some &quot;ohh, I should post that&quot; moments, but more just a matter of thinking about it when I have the time/availability to do it.</p> <p>Also, been really slouching on my blog reading as of late.&nbsp; The past week or two, been working on catching up, but it always seems every so often I get tired of keeping up with various blogs and souch, then it is so hard to get caught up with some posters.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been trimming my blogroll some more since really there are some deeply useful blogs (for a developer) like Coding Horror, and then there are the high volume little relevance ones like Consumerist, and some others who I just simply never manage to stay up on like Seth Godin (Coding Horror is more my alley).</p> <p>Hopefully can do a mind dump over the next few days and get some of these topics in writing.</p>
