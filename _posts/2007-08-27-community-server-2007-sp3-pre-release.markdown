<p>Today, we announced the <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2007/08/27/community-server-2007-sp3-pre-release.aspx">pre-release of Community Server 2007 SP3</a>.&nbsp; Why a pre-release?&nbsp; First, check out the announcement and note the <em>huge</em> list of fixes and enhancements.&nbsp; This drawfs the change list for our earlier service packs.&nbsp; With all those changes, it seemed prudent to have a pre-release for testing purposes before recommending it for roll out to all customers.</p> <p>It is important to emphasize that it is for testing purposes, so don&#39;t necessarily rush it out to&nbsp;mission critical&nbsp;production site.&nbsp; Once we can continue to test the variety of improvements, then we will issue the final release.</p> <p>Overall, it shows that we&#39;ve been really busy in the last two months since SP2, even with development on CS 2008 in full swing.</p>
