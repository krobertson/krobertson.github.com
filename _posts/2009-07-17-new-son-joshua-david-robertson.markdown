<p>Last Friday, on July 10th, 2009, was pleased to welcome a new life into this world.  My second son, Joshua David Robertson, was born at 9:34pm weighing 8lbs 5oz and 19.5" long.  He was originally due for July 22nd, though Trish had a c-section scheduled for Monday, July 13th (our last son was a c-section, it is hospital policy to always give c-sections after you've had one).</p>

<p>Friday night we were getting ready for dinner when Trish started feeling some strong contractions.  She called her doctor who recommend we go in to hook her up to some monitors.  Low and behold, she was at 7cm already and they were rushing to get her ready for the c-section before her water broke.  It was kind of crazy as there were 4-5 nurses in the room getting everything hooked up and ready to go.  All and all, it was 2 hours from when we were sitting at home and Josh was born.</p>

<p>Initially, Josh was on the observation table for the first 12 hours.  He took a gulp of fluid on his way out, so they had to suction his stomach a couple of times and watch to make sure his lungs cleared up.  Apparently, it is common with c-sections.  He was ok by the next morning and was hanging out in the room with Trish from then on.</p>

<p>On top of that, he had a true knot in his cord.  This is where he wiggled his way around and developed a knot in the cord.  If he had been in there longer, or if they tried a normal delivery, it could have easily tightened and cut him off.  He was very lucky.</p>

<p>Trish and Josh came home on Monday and we've been doing very well.  He is adjusting well, Nick (our 1st son, 22 months old) is getting used to him and likes helping out.  Josh is a pretty good sleeper, though still has his days and nights slightly off.</p>

<p>This time, taking advantage of some state programs for family leave, so taking a full 6 weeks off.  So I'm now one week in, my inbox is overflowing, but been enjoying it so far.  Have 5 weeks left, though I don't think I'll be able to make it much longer without doing some sort of dev work.  I've already chimed in on a couple email threads that I couldn't resist.  Will definitely enjoy the remaining time.</p>
