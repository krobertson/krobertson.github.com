<p>I've always loved Google's April Fool's Day jokes.  Their 2006 one, <a href="http://www.google.com/romance/">Google Romance</a> is excellent.  The commentary on the <a href="http://www.google.com/romance/tour.html">tour</a> is great.  Not quite as creative as some of their past ones, like <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/pigeonrank.html">PigeonRank</a>, but still good.</p>
