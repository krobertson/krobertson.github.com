title: From FeedDemon to Rss Bandit

<p>Last night, started using Rss Bandit as my aggregator. So far, like it way better than FeedDemon. Had been using v2.0 for its faced synchronization, but as it turns out, Rss Bandit supports it as well. On top of that, I like its newspaper mode batters, its tabs are better (ie, open all links in a separate tats and covers the post list when switching), does CommentRSS, and has less bugs.</p>
