<p>Blogging has been blowing up and I am constantly amazed when I see TV shows or commercials mentioning blogs.  Something that was for techies and teenagers has been going mainstream in a major way.</p>

<p>Earlier, I had my own confirmation that 'blogs' have hit the mainstream.  Apparently, my grandparents were asking my parents what a blog was.  If that isn't big, then I don't know what is.</p>
