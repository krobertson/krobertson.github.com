<p>It seems odd that sometimes things are invented that serve a very useful purpose, but people still refuse to use them.</p>
<p>Take headphones for instance.&nbsp; I am sitting at DFW, got 2 hours before my flight, and this guy is in here playing a video game on his laptop with the speakers away up, totally oblivious to the fact that he is annoying everybody around him.</p>
