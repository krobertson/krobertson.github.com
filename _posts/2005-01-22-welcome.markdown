<P>Welcome to my new blog!&nbsp; Finally got around to setup the blog on my site.&nbsp; Currently, I am using Community Server (a build between beta3 and the yet to be released RC1).&nbsp; I've also configured it to work in a single blog configuration, as opposed to its default multiple blog configuration.&nbsp; I've also got the gallery configured in the same manner.</P>
<P>Soon, I'll be posting an article with some instructions on how to configure Community Server this way.</P>
