<p>Nothing more gratifying than finally deciding to call it a day and take a little break to play some video games and have some good old fun blowing stuff up.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a>, the folks who graced the world with <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>, that can't happen for me right now.</p>

<p>Yes, and apparently I canâ€™t even launch and start a single-player game without the approval of their internet servers.</p>
<p>Thank you, Valve, for enriching my life!</p>
