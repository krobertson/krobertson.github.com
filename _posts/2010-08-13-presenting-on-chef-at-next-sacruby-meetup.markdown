If you are in the Sacramento area next Thursday, come by the SacRuby Meetup!  I will be presenting on using <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/">Chef</a> for server and configuration management.  I will be talking about using Chef on a large scale with a cluster of servers, all the way down to aiding management of a single server.

If you are in the area, please stop by!  Pizza and refreshments are normally available.
