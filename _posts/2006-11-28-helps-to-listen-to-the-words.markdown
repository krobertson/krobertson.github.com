<p>On my way back from getting lunch today, was listening to the radio and couldn't help but laugh about&nbsp;some of the songs people say mean something to their relationship without really paying attention to what the song is about.&nbsp; The DJ had received a request by email from a guy deployed to Iraq.&nbsp; The guy wanted the DJ to call his wife to let her know she should listen.&nbsp; He wanted the DJ to play this song that heard when they first met at this concert, because it meant a lot to them.&nbsp; Sounds sweet enough, huh?</p> <p>The song he wanted played was called "Lips of an Angel" by Hinder (<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Lips-Of-An-Angel-lyrics-Hinder/998AB4142BC9E3B0482570B5000B9CC8">lyrics</a>), which sounds like it might be a nice song, and if you've heard it, it does have a seemingly sweet melody.&nbsp; The problem?&nbsp; Listen to the lyrics.&nbsp; It is about a guy being tempted to cheat on his girlfriend with his ex.&nbsp; Yeah, nice song to be "meaningful to your relationship".&nbsp; The lyrics talk about how he can't be too loud on the phone because his girlfriend is in the next room, and how she makes it hard for him to be faithful... really nice stuff, huh?</p> <p>I used to always chuckle when people would request "B.Y.O.B." from System of the Down (<a href="http://www.dapslyrics.com/display.php?sid=13343">lyrics</a>).&nbsp; With a name like B.Y.O.B., they probably thought it was about beer or partying.&nbsp; No... its quite anti-war and anti-Bush.</p> <p>So that is my tip for the day...</p>
