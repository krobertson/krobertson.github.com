<p>Was out in the backyard snapping a few photos with my marco lens yesterday and kind of liked this shot (note, it is an artistic rendering).&nbsp; I got this nice Canon 100mm f/2.8 Macro lens for Christmas, but haven&#39;t had much of a chance to use it yet.&nbsp; Kind of interesting though.&nbsp; At 100mm with something right in front of the lens, depth of focus can be wafer thin.&nbsp; A mid-range aperature of 4.5 (mid-range in my opinion) is still wafer thin.&nbsp; For something very up close, you almost need to do f/8 just to get the whole object itself.&nbsp; Also, for macro, you need to be very concious of your breathing and stability.&nbsp; When you&#39;re up that close, with the thin DOF, the slightest movement can cause your focal point to change entirely.&nbsp; I found I kept focusing and then I&#39;d sway back just a hair and would be out of focus.</p>
<p>Having a backyard now will be nice.&nbsp; Should be a lot to take photos of, provided my allergies don&#39;t kill me first.&nbsp; After spending some time on the weekend weeding and cutting out some dead growth, things are really coming back quickly.&nbsp; With spring upon us, it is interesting how a little bit of TLC in the yard and a few days later, it can really look outstanding.</p>
