<p>After finishing my <a href="http://www.qgyen.net/blog/archive/2005/05/27/1046.aspx">lengthy post</a>, I noticed that <a href="http://www.scottwater.com/">Scott</a> <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/forums/485935/ShowPost.aspx">posted</a> the v1.1 RC1 release of Community Server.&nbsp; Go and check it out!&nbsp; A great number of improvements have been made and is truly a&nbsp;excellent follow up to v1.0.</p>
<p>It is also worth <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2005/05/27/485954.aspx">mentioning</a> that early next week, people should be expecting the v1.1 RC1 releases of the NNTP Server and the&nbsp;FTP Server, as well as the v1.1 release of the SecurityModules.</p>
