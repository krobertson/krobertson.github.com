<p>As I am sitting on hold with Comcast Customer Support, let me briefly go over how screwy they are, as I haven&#39;t received an accurate bill since I moved in January:</p> <ul> <li>I was double billed for service in February.</li> <li>I was sent a past due notice before my bill was ever due (ie, my bill was due 2/13, and payment was already in the mail, but on 2/11, they sent me a past due notice).</li> <li>I was billed an &quot;installation charge&quot; for them to come out, take the bad modem they gave me back, and give me a new working one.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t install squat.&nbsp; Got them to waive that charge.</li> <li>I had a credit on my old account that was never carried over to my new account.&nbsp; Actually, the credit turned into a charge.&nbsp; I was supposed to be credited like $90, but was instead billed for $90, for a net difference of about $180.</li></ul> <p>Hopefully I can one day get back to a normal, accurate bill.&nbsp; Suppose it is a lot to ask to just be billed what I am supposed to owe.</p>
