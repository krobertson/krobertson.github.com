<p>Because I just turned off the air conditioning.&nbsp; The air clicked on and I was looking around like "why the heck is it on?"&nbsp; I look at our little indoor/outdoor temperature gauge and it shows it is warmer inside than outside.&nbsp; So why is the air on?</p> <p>Go out in the living room, flip it off, and figure it does warm up, I can simply open a window or the slider in the living room.&nbsp; I was expecting high 70s/low 80s this week, but nice to see it is cooling down.&nbsp; Tired of the heat and the electric bill.</p>
