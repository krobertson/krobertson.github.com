Ken is a core member of the development team on Community Server (<a href="http://www.communityserver.com">www.communityserver.com</a>) and has helped develop the software that runs sites like forums.asp.net, weblogs.asp.net, blogs.msdn.com, and www.netfx3.com. Ken has also worked closely with the CardSpace team to help develop the first implementation of CardSpace utilizing Community Server. </p><p><strong>Topic:</strong> </p><p><strong>CardSpace</strong> </p><p>CardSpace (formerly InfoCard) is a new digital identity system introduced as a part of the .NET Framework 3.0 (formerly WinFX). CardSpace represents a new de-centralized way to manage user&rsquo;s online identities through a collection of unique Information Cards that the user is able to create. We will cover the basis of what CardSpace is and isn&#39;t, talk about what is required to utilize CardSpace, and show an example of a finished end-user experience using CardSpace. Finally, we will cover the process of integrating CardSpace into an application from beginning to end.</p></blockquote>
