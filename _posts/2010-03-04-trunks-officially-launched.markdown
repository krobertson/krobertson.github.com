This morning was looking at my blog and I realized I'd never posted about <a href="https://trunksapp.com/blog/6-it-s-official-we-ve-launched">launching Trunks</a>!

On Monday, I took the beta sticker off Trunks, making it officially available.  Trunks has been doing quite while, and although it still has a small user base, I've been very pleased with its growth.  Over the three months it was in beta, new users were slowly trickling in and even <a href="http://afreshcup.com/home/2010/2/5/double-shot-642.html">got a mention</a> by Mike Gunderloy.  There weren't any major issues that came up, just a few bugs here and there.  In that time, have added a few new features, refined the backend, monitored performance (even though its small, still important), and focused on stability of the systems.

Last week I was talking to a friend about Trunks and they were asking what was left in order to launch it... boiled down to adding diff support and the ability to pay for it (kind of important).  After thinking "that's all," I figured I'd buckle down and finish things off.  Also managed to fit in some UI tweaks and refinements, especially after cringing at the signup page I used to have.

If you haven't already checked out Trunks, <a href="http://trunksapp.com/home">I definitely invite you to</a>.
