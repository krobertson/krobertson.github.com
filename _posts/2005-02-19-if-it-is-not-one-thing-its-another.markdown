<p>I swear, I cannot catch a break.&nbsp; On Thursday, I managed to tweak my neck a little, so that constantly nagging me all day.&nbsp; Friday it was gone, but I also woke up with this head thing that hasn&rsquo;t gone away.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it is a cold, since it is only in mean head/nasal/sinuses, but it is annoying.&nbsp; It is probably allergies, since my allergies always go nuts around the change of the seasons, and weather lately has been back and forth.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be nice and spring like for a few days, with plants/flowers blooming, then rainy for a few days and the molds come back.&nbsp; The trees and flowers around my apartment have been blooming, so I know there is pollen in the air.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t cope with spring and winter allergies at once.&nbsp; Even today, I&rsquo;ve only been up for an hour, but I&rsquo;ve already lost count of the number of times I&rsquo;ve had to blow my nose.&nbsp; Will it ever stop?!?</p>
