<p>As you may have heard from either <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2005/02/18/alex_and_ts">Scott</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2005/02/18/376453.aspx">Rob</a>, or the <a href="http://www.communityserver.org/forums/473043/ShowPost.aspx">Community Server message boards</a>, Community Server v1.0 is out!&nbsp; It is truly a great honor to have been able to work on it.&nbsp; The team of people working on it are absolutely awesome and it is great to be able to bounce ideas back and forth off of them.&nbsp; Definitely looking forward to continuing to come up with new ideas to add to it to make it even better.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m glad to welcome <a href="http://callmealex.com/cs/default.aspx">Alex Lowe</a>&nbsp;to the Telligent team.&nbsp; He will be Project Manager on the <a href="http://callmealex.com/cs/archive/2005/02/18/4.aspx">www.asp.net website</a>&nbsp;project, so if you have any ideas on what you&rsquo;d like to see there, go and drop him a line.</p>
