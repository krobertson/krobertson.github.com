title: Nerdbooks moved to Texas!?

<p>I was very disappointed this morning.&nbsp; I was reading on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">weblogs.asp.net</a> and came across <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lhunt/archive/2005/03/10/392248.aspx">this post</a>.&nbsp; I was like &ldquo;ohh yeah, I know of <a href="http://www.nerdbooks.com/">Nerdbooks</a>, they&rsquo;re over in Roseville.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not any more!&nbsp; Go to the website and see that now they&rsquo;ve moved to Richardson, Texas!</p>
<p>Very sad indeed.&nbsp; They were a great bookstore.&nbsp; Obviously, haven&rsquo;t been out there in a while (since they moved in July), but they had almost anything.&nbsp; Used to go there for some of my college books (bookstore would be sold out or&nbsp;they&rsquo;d have it cheaper).&nbsp; Now where will I be able to get the hard to find tech books locally?</p>
