title: New Papercut release!

<p>This afternoon, finally zipped up and released a new version of Papercut.  This release features:

<ul>
<li>Our first release to CodePlex!  Yes, Papercut is now a <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/">CodePlex project</a>, and also hosts the <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">source</a>.  Feel free to grab the source, contribute patches, and enjoy.</li>
<li>Fixes a long standing bug with the handling of quoted printable messages where stray equal signs (=) would show up within messages.  I had fixed this bug a while ago, but was slow to actually package up a release.</li>
<li>The forward message dialog box now remembers the settings you enter.  I had to use Papercut this afternoon, found myself wishing it remembered the settings, so I quickly opened the project and added it in.</li>
</ul>

<p>So please head on over and <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=37467">download it now</a>!</p>
