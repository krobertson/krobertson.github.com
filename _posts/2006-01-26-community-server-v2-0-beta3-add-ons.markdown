<p>Today, we posted the v2.0 Beta3 builds of the NNTP, FTP, and Security Modules add-ons.&nbsp; For more, <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/thread/511699.aspx">read the announcement</a>.&nbsp; There is not anything that new in the releases, but they have been updated to work with CS v2.0 Beta3 and use the new license file management, and the FTP and NNTP both have a couple of annoying bug fixes incorporated into them.</p>
