<p>... where is my Community Server site?</p>

<p>Sorry for the corny quote of biblical proportions, but today is the epic day that we officially released <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/thread/516103.aspx">Community Server v2.0</a>.  This release truly is huge, as it is leap and bounds ahead of v1.0 and even v1.1.</p>

<p>And there is no better time to release it, since precisely one year ago from Saturday, we <a href="http://communityserver.org/forums/thread/473043.aspx">released Community Server v1.0</a>.  It is hard to image how far we have some since then.  In my opinion, we have made an incredible amount of progress in such a short amount of time.  We have greatly expanded our features, usability, stability, extendability (ok, was on a -bility roll).</p>

<p>If we can make this much progress in one year from v1.0 to v2.0, just imagine what is going to come in v3.0.  Tomorrow, the Community Server team is flying into Dallas to lay out the plan for v2.1, and more importantly, v3.0.  I am certainly very excited and anxious to begin work on v3.0.</p>
