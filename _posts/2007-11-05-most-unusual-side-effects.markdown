<p>The other night, was watching TV with Trish when one of the dozens of prescription drug commercials came on.&nbsp; Normally just ignore them, but one part of caught my ear.</p> <p>It was a commercial for <a href="http://www.mirapex.com/">Miraplex</a>, which treats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome">restless leg syndrome</a>.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.mirapex.com/con_faqs.jsp#q9">side effect</a> was that users &quot;may experience increased urges for gambling&quot;.&nbsp; Gambling?</p> <p>I think that one is easily explained.&nbsp; Someone in their trials went out to Vegas, Atlantic City, or somewhere like that, lost a bunch of money, and then came home and said the drug made him do it in order to get out of the dog house with his wife.</p> <p>They have two other interesting side effects: compulsive eating and increased sex drive.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; Is one of those really bad?&nbsp; I mean&nbsp;for&nbsp;some people, Miraplex could take the place of Viagra.</p>
