<p>The end of June is shaping up to be a busy month.  Have been having to check my schedule to make sure things don't overlap.</p>

<p>Have the June <a href="http://www.sacdotnet.org/sacdnug/index.aspx">Sacramento .NET User Group</a> meeting on the 27th, followed a day later by a lovely dentist appointment.  The week before, have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_(band">Styx</a>) concert (the greatest band).</p>

<p>And, unfortunately, the one conflict I have is with <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">BloggerCon</a> June 23-24, since I will be in Dallas.  I had been looking forward to BloggerCon and representing Telligent/Community Server, but it got organized kind of late, and then I realized I wasn't going to be able to make it.</p>

<p>Perhaps next time... it would be nice to get Community Server a little bit more exposure outside of the Microsoft/.NET world.</p>
