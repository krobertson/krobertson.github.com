Finally posting about it a little bit late, but last week was my first
week in a new position with a new company.  I truly enjoyed my stay at
[Involver](http://www.involver.com/), but saw an opportunity pop up and decided to take it.

This new opportunity is to be one of the first in-house Ruby developers
at [Demandbase](http://www.demandbase.com).  Demandbase specializes in a
B2B analytics API for reporting and logging information about visitors
hitting your business's website.

That all sounds fancy, but the gist is I'll be helping to grow and form
the team, scale up and expand the platform, and able to leverage both
skillsets as a developer and in operations.  They've been working with
the awesome guys from [Highgroove](http://highgroove.com/), utilizing
Chef in a continuous deployment setup, doing geographic load balancing, and have a pretty agile and
responsive process setup.

I had an amazing time at Involver and grew so much personally and
professionally.  I was a part of some major projects and instrumented a
lot of change.  Our Operations team was top notch and put out of a lot
of stuff considering it was only 3 people.

Going forward, have some goodies I'll hopefully be working on and open
sourcing.  There are a lot of interesting things in the works and hope
to post about them over time.

And by the way, Demandbase is hiring.  Hit me up
