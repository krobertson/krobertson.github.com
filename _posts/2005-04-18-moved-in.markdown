<p>Moved into my new apartment over on Sunday and having fun unpacking and setting everything up.&nbsp; It takes far longer to unpack than it does to pack it all.&nbsp; It took me nearly all day to get the office, network, and my desktop back up.&nbsp; Mainly because I am quite particular about how I want everything laid out and wired up.&nbsp; Also because I keep forgetting things and having to run to the store.</p>
<p>At any rate, slowly getting things back in order and should be back at 100% capacity soon.</p>
<p>If you want to take a look at the place, <a href="http://www.qgyen.net/photos/category1060.aspx">check it out</a>.&nbsp; Pictures were from last week when Trish and I were painting it.&nbsp; It looks quite different now with things actually in it.&nbsp; Will have to take some more in a few days when the boxes are all put away and I don&rsquo;t have stuff strewn all around in the living room and dining room.</p>
<p>Ohh, and a note to anyone I work with, if I said I was going to send you something or something like that, please remind me or hound me until I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been kind of easily side tracked as I keep wandering off to unpack things as I realize I can&rsquo;t find something.</p>
