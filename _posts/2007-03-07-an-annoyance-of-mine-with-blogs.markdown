<p>One thing I&#39;ve been noticing lately with a variety of blog platforms is the inconsistency of pagination labels when browsing posts.&nbsp; What is next and what is previous?&nbsp; Does next point to older posts or does it point to older posts?</p> <p>They are pretty consistent as far as links to &quot;previous&quot; being on the left and links to &quot;next&quot; going on the right, but there isn&#39;t consistency as far as the direction they take you.</p> <p>Case in point:</p> <ul> <li>Look at my blog, running Community Server (but of course!).&nbsp; Jump to the button and you will find the &quot;Next page&quot; button.&nbsp; Click it, read some entries, and then reach the button of page two, and you will see previous and next.&nbsp; Since you were reading some other entries (I hope!), you don&#39;t exactly remember the label of the link you pressed on the next page, but logically, what makes to you?&nbsp; You are looking for older entries, but you view them as far as going back in time, so &quot;next&quot; to you means &quot;the next page of ones you haven&#39;t seen yet&quot; and previous means &quot;the page of posts you saw before&quot;.</li> <li>Look at this <a href="http://marketallica.wordpress.com/">Wordpress blog</a> (found randomly on Wordpress.com).&nbsp; Scroll to the bottom and all you see is a &quot;Previous entries&quot; button.&nbsp; You likely won&#39;t pay much attention to it though, it is the only option, you know where it goes, so you click it without comprehending its label.&nbsp; You read some other posts and reach the bottom of page 2 and now you see &quot;Previous entries&quot; and &quot;Next entries&quot;, basically the same labels as before, however completely opposite meanings.&nbsp; In this case, &quot;Next entries&quot; goes to the page you already saw, and &quot;Previous entries&quot; goes to the page of posts you haven&#39;t seen, and are likely looking for.&nbsp; Wordpress, or at least in the case of that particular skin (or a recurring theme in the common skins), is to view the label in the context of time rather than the context the reader would be looking at it.&nbsp; &quot;Next entries&quot; goes to newer posts, but the reader may be thinking &quot;the next page of posts I haven&#39;t seen yet&quot;.</li></ul> <p>Overall, I would have to side with how Community Server works in this case.&nbsp; Draw a parallel over to how virtually all forum/message boards work.&nbsp; Page 1 has the latest threads/posts, and the higher in page numbers you go, the older the posts.&nbsp; Next is obviously &quot;current page + 1&quot;.&nbsp; Wordpress, in this case, has the latest posts on the first page, but previous means &quot;current page + 1&quot; and next means &quot;current page - 1&quot;.</p> <p>For blogs in particular, due to the inconsistency, it may be better to move to a more descriptive &quot;older entries&quot; and &quot;newer entries&quot; label, but for the most part, the developers should look at the page from the perspective of &quot;what will the end-user be thinking when they run across this?&quot;</p>
