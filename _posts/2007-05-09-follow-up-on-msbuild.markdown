<p>As a follow up on <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2007/05/08/getting-up-to-speed-with-continuous-integration.aspx">my post yesterday</a> about continuous integration, I am really starting to like MSBuild.&nbsp; Sure, it has a few quirks, but with the <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/">MSBuild Community Tasks</a>, they have tasks for most of the things I want to do, and it doesn&#39;t look very hard to write your own tasks.&nbsp; Sure, you have to write/compile your custom tasks as opposed to kind of scripting them with nant, but that isn&#39;t much of a problem, in my opinion.&nbsp; Additionally, it is one less application I need to mess with.&nbsp; Why learn CruiseControl.NET, nAnt, <em>and</em> MSBuild, when I can get it all done with just CruiseControl.NET and MSBuild.&nbsp; One less thing to deal with.</p> <p>Also, I <em>highly</em> recommend <a href="http://dotnet.org.za/cjlotz/archive/2007/04/04/part-1-continuous-integration-using-msbuild-cruisecontrol-net-fxcop-nunit-ncover-subversion.aspx">this series of posts</a> by <a href="http://dotnet.org.za/cjlotz/">Carel Lotz</a> on setting up CCNet and MSBuild with Subversion, FxCop, NUnit, and NCover.&nbsp; I was reading it last night through Google cache (the site was down for a while) and it got me up and going very quickly.&nbsp; Covers a nice range of tasks very clearly with clean build scripts.&nbsp; Was able to quickly take some of its basics and begin getting MSBuild to do what I needed.</p> <p>Think tonight I&#39;m going to write my first custom task.&nbsp; I already got it to build a project and it tracks all the output DLLs, but I also want it to parse a project file to find all the file-based references.&nbsp; I found how to get a project&#39;s references, but in the form of the full assembly reference, couldn&#39;t get the path to the file it referenced.&nbsp; Going to write a task that can open a project file as XML, get its references as files, and then return the list.</p>
