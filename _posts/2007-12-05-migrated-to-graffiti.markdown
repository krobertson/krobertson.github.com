<p>Today, the release of <a _tesavedurl="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2007/12/05/announcing-telligent-graffiti-cms-beta-1.aspx" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2007/12/05/announcing-telligent-graffiti-cms-beta-1.aspx">Graffiti Beta1 was announced</a>, and overall it looks pretty solid.&nbsp; It has been interesting watching Graffiti progress over the past couple of months.&nbsp; Overall, it is incredibly powerful.&nbsp; The ease at which you can develop event modules, widgets, or add Chalk objects for use in themes is awesome.&nbsp; Want a new theme?&nbsp; Can just upload a theme as XML and it sets up all of the files.&nbsp; Wouldn't be surprised to find a lot of the simplicity ideas work their way back into Community Server.</p>
<p>For more information on Graffiti, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.graffiticms.com" _tesavedurl="http://www.graffiticms.com">graffiticms.com</a> (the live site coming soon), and the documentation site at <a href="http://docs.graffiticms.com" _tesavedurl="http://docs.graffiticms.com">docs.graffiticms.com</a>.&nbsp; Solid documentation from the start has been a goal of the project since early on, and there is already a wealth of information on the docs site, and it is really easy to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p>So why did I make the switch to Graffiti?&nbsp; More and more, Community Server is focusing on <em>communities</em>.&nbsp; Although CS can be configured to run as just a single personal blog, it carries a whole ton of weight that makes it really big for just a personal blog.&nbsp; Graffiti is a much smaller application, geared specifically for a site and managing its content.&nbsp; It fits in perfectly as a platform for a personal blog.&nbsp; CS does what it does well, but for this site, Graffiti does it better.</p>
<p>I've imported all of my old posts with a currently early alpha migrator by our <a href="http://ndepth.net/" _tesavedurl="http://ndepth.net/">Jayme Davis</a>.&nbsp; I've also used <a href="http://richmercer.com/" _tesavedurl="http://richmercer.com/">Rich Mercer</a>'s module to <a href="http://richmercer.com/redirecting-community-server-links-to-graffiti/" _tesavedurl="http://richmercer.com/redirecting-community-server-links-to-graffiti/">handle redirects</a> from Community Server URLs.&nbsp; All my old posts, I've put into an &quot;Archive&quot; category.&nbsp; I've also decided to drop tags.&nbsp; I found tags too laborious and mostly irrelevant.&nbsp; Simple categories are usually more effective, as I never used to be good about tagging posts, and sometimes it just leads to bloated tag clouds.&nbsp; Instead, future posts will just be grouped into a small collection of categories.</p>
