<p>After doing some research into new laptops, I think I will likely be waiting a few months.&nbsp; The main reason is that I want something that will be fully compatible with Windows Vista and will last me the next couple of years.&nbsp; The best suited would be the new Core Duo set of chips, but only a limited number of laptops have come out using it (with limited availability).&nbsp; Additionally, it looks like Intel is coming out with a low voltage version, which will probably be more suited to laptops.</p>
<p>So, in the interest of getting something that will suit me best and last the longest, I will probably be waiting a few months.&nbsp; If I get a tablet, it would likely be the <a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cmod.to?coid=-30603">Toshiba M400</a>, <a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/thinkpad/x-t.html?re=home_primary_us">IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad T60</a>, or possibly a Dell Latitude if one comes out.</p>
<p>EDIT: I did manage to find <a href="http://www-131.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=-840&amp;productId=4611686018425151858&amp;storeId=10000001&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=2049168&amp;dualCurrId=1000073&amp;sourceid0=CNETdatafeed00000000&amp;ca=affiliate&amp;me=A&amp;met=exbaAFwww.befree.&amp;re=search.mysimon.com">this</a>, which looks like a nice 1.83ghz Core Duo T60 with 14" screen.&nbsp; May prefer a 2ghz Core Duo 14" though.</p>
