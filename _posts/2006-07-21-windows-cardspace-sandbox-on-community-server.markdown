<p>I forgot to post about this a couple of days ago when it was launched, but wanted to mention that the <a href="http://sandbox.netfx3.com/">CardSpace Sandbox</a> went live a couple of days ago.  It showcases the <a href="http://wcs.netfx3.com/">Windows CardSpace</a> functionality in the <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/">.NET Framework 3.0</a>.</p>

<p>If you have IE7 Beta 3 installed and the July CTP of NetFX3, you should definitely check it out.  Or if you have a spare virtual machine sitting around, install it on there and check it out.</p>

<p>Very excited to see the first implementation of CardSpace is a Community Server based site!  Eventually, we will be making some of the code public and releasing the authentication module once the framework RTMs.  The CardSpace integration with Community Server is one of the things I will be showcasing and discussing at my talk at the <a href="http://www.sacdotnet.org/sacdnug/index.aspx">Sacramento .NET User Group</a>.</p>
