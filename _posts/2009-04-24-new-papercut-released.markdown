title: New Papercut released!

<p>Last year, I had <a href="http://invalidlogic.com/software/introducing-papercut/">introduced Papercut</a> as a simple utility for testing email capabilities of a site or application. &nbsp;Since then, I've used it quite frequently and&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;get emails from others who've also found it useful (I always appreciate those).</p>
<p>Tonight, I am pleased to release a new release. &nbsp;Although it isn't ground breaking, it fixes a few minor nuances I've had and adds some new functionality I've really been wanting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added the ability to send messages on to a live email server. &nbsp;Get the test message in Papercut but want to see it in a live client? &nbsp;Can forward it on and chose which mail server to send it to and the from/to users in the SMTP commands. &nbsp;It doesn't alter the message, only the commands executed on the server (so it will go to the specified user).</li>
    <li>Ensure the window is raised to the top when you click the tray icon and it is already open.</li>
    <li>Changed the raw view of messages to use a fixed width font (Consolas or Courier New) and widened the default window some so a full line would fit in the main view.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with clicking the delete button too quickly. &nbsp;It would try to delete the same message twice and could cause an error. &nbsp;It will now handle rapid clicking.</li>
    <li>Added multiple selection in the message list so you can now do bulk deletes. &nbsp;Hit Ctrl-A, select all, and hit delete. &nbsp;Yay!</li>
</ul>
