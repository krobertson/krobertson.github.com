<p>Over the weekend <a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/download_beta.asp">UltraMon 3.0 beta</a> was finally released.&nbsp; UltraMon has been the only thing missing from my system since my switch to Vista.&nbsp; The previous releases of UltraMon were somewhat unstable/unreliable on Vista, and did not support the Vista styling.&nbsp; Finally, they have released their 3.0 beta and I have been using it for a few days without any problems.&nbsp; <em>Very</em> glad to get back to my old taskbar layout... helps to reduce the clutter a lot.</p>
