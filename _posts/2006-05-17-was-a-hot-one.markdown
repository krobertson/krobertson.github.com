<p>It was a hot Mother's Day on Sunday.  On Sunday, we went to <a href="http://www.mgzoo.com/regionalfacilities.htm#Micke%20Grove%20Regional%20Park">Mickey Grove Park</a> with my wife's family (my parents were supposed to come, but unfortunately, my mom wasn't feel well... she is better now though).  I took this picture when we got in the car on the way home.</p>

<p>I don't always trust the temperature sensor in the car, as I sometimes wonder if the heat of the engine or road could influence it, or if the wind could cool it off, etc.  Though this was on the way home, when we had been driving for a while, so if it was cooling it off, it would have done it already.</p>
