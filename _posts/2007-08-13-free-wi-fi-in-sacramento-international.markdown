<p>Today, I&#39;m flying out to Dallas for the week as a&nbsp;kind of a mini-meetup of various Telligent remote staff.&nbsp; Just got to through security for my 11:50am flight and was surprised to find that the wi-fi access is now free!&nbsp; No more ripoff rates for the T-Mobile hotspot when you know you&#39;ll only be on like an hour.&nbsp; Very pleasant surprise.</p>
