Please excuse my currently broken Gallery.&nbsp; Today, I was updating my site to the latest bits of Community Server v2.0.&nbsp; The last time I updated, to get the single blog and gallery, I had made a minor code change, but this time I was trying to do it using what was there out of the box and ran into an issue using both at the same time.&nbsp; Working on figuring it out.
