title: Cooking with Chef slides
---

A little late, but I have posted my slides from my talk at the [East Bay
Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EBRuby/) in [June](http://www.meetup.com/EBRuby/events/16505489/).

<center><div style="width:425px;margin: 10px" id="__ss_8668127"><strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/krobertson2/cooking-with-chef-8668127" title="Cooking with Chef">Cooking with Chef</a></strong><object id="__sse8668127" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=cheftalk-110722221912-phpapp02&stripped_title=cooking-with-chef-8668127&userName=krobertson2" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse8668127" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=cheftalk-110722221912-phpapp02&stripped_title=cooking-with-chef-8668127&userName=krobertson2" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div></center>

Check them out and feel free to ping me if there are any questions.  At
the meetup, was also talking about doing a bit of a blog series on
getting started with Chef and posting some of the scripts and baseline
setup I have used before.  Hope to start forming some simple getting started resources.
