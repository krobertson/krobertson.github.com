Don’t you just love it when things just work?&nbsp; Tonight, I was working with some code that I’d written a short while ago, but never tested or tried it out.&nbsp; Figured I should make it works (as it was needed for my next part), and after a quick runtime error in the skin file (missing reference), the page loaded, did my thing, it posted back (with fingers crossed and covering my eyes except for a small crack between the fingers), and it actually worked.&nbsp; Its always a great feeling when that happens. :)
