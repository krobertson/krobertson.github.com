<p>Have been working on a new take on Papercut (details coming soon) when I noticed that there were several issues opened in Codeplex and a number of patches submitted.  I'd forgotten to enable email notifications!  So decided to sit down and felt some of them merited a new release.  Release notes below.</p>
