<p>Been keeping busy with my camera as of late...</p>
<p>Superbowl weekend, was snapping away some more with the Sigma 30mm f/1.4.<br />[photo:1373] [photo:1419]</p>
<p>Last weekend, the wife and I found this really nice sandwich shop nearby. They are a little unusual in that they don't have any soda fountain. They just have bottled drinks, and mostly some of the less common brands. Here is a shot of this "Apple Beer" soda I got during the week. I've been digging the partial desaturation look, so this one was about -75 saturation.<br />[photo:1408]</p>
<p>Last night, we were up in Sacramento to go out to dinner for my father-in-law's birthday. Afterwards, Trish and I went down to Old Sacramento with the camera and tripod in hand to walk around snapping some shots. Came back with some pretty good ones! Were down by the river and got a nice panoramic of the Delta King and the old train station down there. Got some other shots of the draw bridge as a boat was going under it, though haven't processed those yet.<br />[photo:1417] [photo:1415] [photo:1416]</p>
<p>And the Delta King...<br />[photo:1418]</p>
<p>Going downtown with the camera was nice. I thought it would be awkward going around with the tripod and all the equipment (though got a nice little backpack to carry all of it), but it wasn't at all. It is surprising how people will stop for you to take a shot without even being asked when you got a nice, big camera and a tripod all set up. :)</p>
