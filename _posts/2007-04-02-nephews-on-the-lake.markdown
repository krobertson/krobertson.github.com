<p>I&#39;ve been sitting on these photos for nearly 6 months and finally got around to posting them.&nbsp; Back in the beginning of October, I took these shots of my nephews at Lodi Lake as a part of a Christmas present with my in-laws for my sister-in-law.&nbsp; I would take the photos, and then they would get them framed.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t easy getting a 22 month old and an 18 month old to cooperate to take photos, but we got compliance for about 20 minutes, while I shot around 300 photos, and ended up with about 30 keepers.&nbsp; You can see the full collection of the keepers in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/qgyen/sets/72157600043022071/">my Flickr set</a>.&nbsp; Below are some of the highlights.</p> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/176/443700447_133123379e_b.jpg' title='Looking out to the lake' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/443700447/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[nephews]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/176/443700447_133123379e_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/171/443675118_5867327f74_b.jpg' title='Watching the ducks closely' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/443675118/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[nephews]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/171/443675118_5867327f74_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/181/443674934_54c6335ffb_b.jpg' title='Cute smile 1' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/443674934/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[nephews]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/181/443674934_54c6335ffb_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/192/443667661_baa5129f6c_b.jpg' title='Mid-throw' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/443667661/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[nephews]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/192/443667661_baa5129f6c_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/172/443655720_4223757968_b.jpg' title='Fixed on the bread' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/443655720/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[nephews]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/172/443655720_4223757968_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/199/443655708_e84aa6ac8a_b.jpg' title='Deep in throught' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/443655708/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox[nephews]'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/199/443655708_e84aa6ac8a_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <p>They loved the photos.  I had to sit on them until at least Christmas, since we didn&#39;t want to let anyone else see them to possibly let it leak out that we&#39;d taken the photos.  Since Christmas, I&#39;ve been meaning to post them, but never quite got around to it.  Finally decided to do it.</p>
