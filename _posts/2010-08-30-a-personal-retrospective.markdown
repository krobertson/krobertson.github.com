title: A Personal Retrospective

I'd heard of people applying agile methodologies to their lives through things like personal kanban.  I recently decided to apply another practice: retrospectives.  Sounds simple, but when I thought about it, it really isn't that often that I sit down and take stock of where I am and have action items at the end of it.

The idea is simple.  Get away from distractions for a while.  Grab a whiteboard, piece of paper, or whatever you have.  Mark out three columns.  In the first, list the things that have been going well or that you like about where you are in life.  In the second, list the things you don't like.  And in the final, come up with a resolution or first action item for each of the things you don't like.

The goal of it is to acknowledge what has been going well, figure out what hasn't, and get the ball rolling on tackling those.  Just like you do with your projects!

I am by no means an agile expert, or a super organized, together person.  But I was thinking about how it has been 3 months since making a rather big career change and wanted to take stock of how things have gone, but personally and not just professionally.

Try it for yourself and see how it goes.  For me, I think a 3 month rotation is about right.
