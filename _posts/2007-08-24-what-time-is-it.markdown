<p>Last night I did something I haven&#39;t done in a long time... I stayed up to 2am, on a week night, coding.&nbsp; It caught me rather off guard.&nbsp; I was getting into bed when I looked at the clock and it said 1:50am.&nbsp; I stopped for a second, thinking it must be an hour ahead.&nbsp; But then I remembered seeing the clock on my laptop&#39;s taskbar at 12:59am, and thinking to myself it was time for bed.&nbsp; But then I got into the &quot;ohh, just do this real quick... and that... and this... one more&quot; and when I finally shutdown and crawled into bed, it was almost an hour later.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t done that in a while.&nbsp; Nowadays, if I&#39;m on the computer, I&#39;ll be falling asleep at the keyboard by midnight.&nbsp; Before I was married, I used to stay up until 2-3am <em>every night</em>, and most of the time was coding til then.&nbsp; I used to have people rag on me for making forum posts on CommunityServer.org at 3am.&nbsp; There were times I&#39;d be just going to bed as <a href="http://scottwater.com/">Scott</a> or <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/">Rob</a> were waking up in the morning.</p> <p>The change wasn&#39;t really that I started sleeping more, but more that I shifted my schedule.&nbsp; I get up in the morning earlier than I used, and so I tend to go to bed a few hours earlier than I used to.&nbsp; Though it still gives a small sense of satisfaction when you roll into bed in the wee AM hours after a good coding session.</p>
