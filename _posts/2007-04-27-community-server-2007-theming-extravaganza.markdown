<p>Today, the <a href="http://docs.communityserver.org/wiki/page.aspx/239/community-server-2007-theming-extravaganza/">Community Server 2007 Theming Extravaganza</a> was announced.&nbsp; Definitely something to check out!&nbsp; The contest has two different &quot;tracks&quot; or categories you can enter.</p> <p>The first is to build the best theme you can on top of the existing CS 2007 theme.&nbsp; This would be mostly by leveraging CSS and the dyanming theming functionality in Chameleon.&nbsp; With this, it could be easily exported/imported onto any Community Server site, with very minimal changes to the filesystem (maybe needs some new images or something).</p> <p>The second is to build a completely new theme, including all the pages customized to your creative desire.&nbsp; This isn&#39;t for just a cool new blog skin, but rather aimed at an entire site skin.&nbsp; In the past, CS has been difficult for people to do entire site skins, however Chameleon really does make it far easier.&nbsp; Chameleon controls are leveraged throughout the entire site, so there is a lot of similiarity between how all the controls work and how they can be extended or customized.</p> <p>So what is there to make it all worth it?&nbsp; Beyond the good feeling you&#39;ll get from contributing to the CS community (*grin*), this contest has the biggest prizes we&#39;ve ever had before.&nbsp; First place in both tracks is a brand new MacBook, followed by a second place prize of a new Xbox 360 Elite (the cool new black 360 with HDMI and a 120gb HD), and third is a $100 Amazon gift card.&nbsp; Even better, <em>everybody</em> who enters with a valid entry (ie, didn&#39;t just change 1 color) will win a license for Community Server 2007 Personal Edition.</p> <p>Also worth noting, Telligent employees can enter, but can&#39;t win, so this will guarantee that the community will be getting these awesome prizes.</p> <p>Definitely check out the <a href="http://docs.communityserver.org/wiki/page.aspx/239/community-server-2007-theming-extravaganza/">announcement</a>, and then head over to <a href="http://getben.com/">Ben&#39;s blog</a> and check out <a href="http://getben.com/tags/Chameleon/default.aspx">his series on Chameleon</a> to get up to speed!</p>
