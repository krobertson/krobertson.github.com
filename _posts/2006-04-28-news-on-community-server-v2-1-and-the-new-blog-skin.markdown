<p>Some of you may have noticed that a few days ago Alex <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2006/04/25/527062.aspx">posted an update</a> on Community Server v2.1's progress.  One thing it mentions is that it will be released July 2006.  This has produced a certain amount of clammouring on the forums, and should be noted that it isn't set in stone.  Release dates are very hard to predict if you don't have a hard requirement (like releasing to coincide with a conference or something).  So July is somewhat of a worse-case scenario.  Plus, we always prefer at least about a month of betas before reaching a final release phase, so a public version is not very far off.</p>

<p>Other thing worth noting is that the <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/">CS Announcements blog</a> is now an attractive new blog skin called Paperclip that will be included in CS v2.1 with a couple of varients.  I like it so much, it almost makes me want to dump my current skin!</p>
