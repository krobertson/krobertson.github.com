<p>Updated my site to Community Server v1.0 finally&hellip; been busy with work lately, but finally got a couple of things done that I&rsquo;ve been trying to finish up.</p>
<p>This is now my permanent blog home, no longer going to be using my weblogs.asp.net blog as much, though I&rsquo;ll probably post there occassionally for certain posts to get certain exposure.</p>
