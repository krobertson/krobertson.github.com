<p>What desktop search programs do you recommend?</p>
<p>Lately, I've been using <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a>, and find its file search and web history search to be great, however I am disappointed by its email and IM searching.&nbsp; I use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> for all my messanging, and can't find any way to tell it "look here for chat logs".&nbsp; With emails, I regularly move my emails to subfolder, and then later to a local PST file (so I don't go over my mailbox quota).&nbsp; Google isn't really good at updating its indexes, so I will search for something in Outlook, then go to open it, and it says it can't find it.&nbsp; Only way to view the email is to have it search in IE and view the message in IE, but if I click to open it in Outlook, it won't find it.</p>
<p>I used to use <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/lookoutinfo.html">LookOut</a> for my email searching within Outlook, which was bought up by Microsoft to put into <a href="http://toolbar.msn.com/">MSN Toolbar</a>.&nbsp; I'd tried MSN Toolbar, but was kind of disappointed that its email search wasn't the same as LookOut was.&nbsp; I believe it also didn't pickup on chat logs for Trillian.</p>
<p>So what are people using nowadays?&nbsp; I've been thinking of going back to MSN Toolbar, since I don't think I'd used v2.5, but the main thing I'd hope it would be able to handle would be updating indexes.for emails.</p>
