<p>Just saw this while killing some tonight... Forbes came out with its <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/08/15/best-states-business_cz_kb_0815beststates.html">Best States For Business</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/9/06beststates_The-Best-States-For-Business_Rank.html?thisSpeed=35000">the list</a>).&nbsp; Interestingly, California is way down at #36 (or the 15th worst state).&nbsp; However, Texas is all the way at #2.</p>
