title: Trillian not working with MSN Messanger?

<p>Not sure what has been going on, but ever since yesterday afternoon, I have not been able to connect to MSN with Trillian anymore.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t the slightest clue why either.&nbsp; I can connect with the actual MSN Messanger 7 Beta, but nothing with Trillian.</p>
<p>Trillian is set to connect to messenger.hotmail.com port 1863.&nbsp; Messanger doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any options for the MSN server to use, and I haven&rsquo;t bothered listing the open network ports yet.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t see why that would change though.</p>
<p>None the less, very annoying.&nbsp; I was happy with my Trillian and I&rsquo;m not about to give it up.</p>
