<p>Sitting here working on some code for my little project (after getting my little development board working last night) and was cleaning up some sample code I had downloaded when I realized exactly how obsessive I am about code formatting.&nbsp; Here are a few things just to give you an idea:</p> <ul> <li>Tabs, not spaces for indenting  <li>Brackets around code blocks begin on new lines, not on the same line  <li>Space around assignment and comparison (ie, i = 0 instead of i=0, and a == b instead of a==b)  <li>No space before statements (ie, if(i) instead of if (i))  <li>Spaces before comments (ie, // comment instead of //comment)  <li>Clean consice function names (I love camel case, but <em>hate</em> the "m_", "s_" style stuff... boo!)  <li>Short, precise functions (KISS = Keep It Short &amp; Simple, break down your functions, short and to the point, no monolothic/does-everything functions)  <li>Grammar and spelling - ok, it is code, so it doesn't hurt anyone, but I don't like seeing grammatical or spelling errors in code</li></ul> <p>Can't think of anything else right now.&nbsp; I always configure these kind of rules into ReSharper and always clean up any sample code I download and plan on making using of.&nbsp; For myself, it goes a long way to increase readability.</p> <p>What are you obsessive about in your code?</p>
