<p>With it now being spring, its nice to <em>finally</em> be able to make some good use of my macro lens.&nbsp; I got it back at Christmas, but in the winter, there aren&#39;t a whole lot of interesting things to take macro photos of in the winter in California.&nbsp; But in the spring, that all changes.</p><a href='http://static.flickr.com/184/445576218_77959ae70d_b.jpg' title='Flowers in backyard' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/445576218/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/184/445576218_77959ae70d_m.jpg' border='0' class='floatright'></a>  <p>Before all the spring flower really come (things in our backyard are still working on blooming), I&#39;d like to figure out some better ways to make those spring colors pop out.&nbsp; Get vibrant red/yellows and greens.&nbsp; During a little break earlier this afternoon, had gone out back to snap some photos and was toying around some color adjustments.&nbsp; Not quite as easy as I thought... there are a lot of things you can do.&nbsp; I like this photo for its nice &quot;cool&quot; look, but the greens turned out a little darker than I would have liked... perhaps &quot;cool&quot; and vibrant greens don&#39;t mesh well.</p><a href='http://static.flickr.com/239/445576222_60cfc51ac9_b.jpg' title='Black/white' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/445576222/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/239/445576222_60cfc51ac9_m.jpg' border='0' class='floatleft'></a>  <p>But I do like taking some of the photos and turning them into black and whites.&nbsp; There are several ways to make black and whites.&nbsp; Overall, I think B&amp;W is easier since there is less overall to them, but still several methods, each that produces different results, and there are several styles.&nbsp; Lately, I&#39;ve been playing with another method for B&amp;Ws I&#39;d found.&nbsp; So far, I like some of the results.</p> <p>This one had a little bit more pop to it and think it turned out better.&nbsp; I also liked the greater level of contrast in its B&amp;W version.</p> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/214/445576230_0d1a902af4_b.jpg' title='IMG_4089' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/445576230/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/214/445576230_0d1a902af4_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div> <div align="center"><a href='http://static.flickr.com/234/445576236_5d4ad74b3b_b.jpg' title='IMG_4089_bw' details='http://www.flickr.com/photos/99026274@N00/445576236/' detailsText='Flickr page' rel='lightbox'><img src='http://static.flickr.com/234/445576236_5d4ad74b3b_m.jpg' border='0' class=''></a></div>
