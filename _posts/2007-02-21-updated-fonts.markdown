<p>Yes, I finally applied the style update to make my site more elder-friendly (I kid, I kid).</p> <p>I increased the font size of the comments (they were small), I darkened the normal text color, shrunk some of the paragraph spacing in the comments (was a little whacked out), and fixed the header from showing up clipped in IE (you should be using Firefox anyway).</p>
