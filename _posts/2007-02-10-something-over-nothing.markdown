<p>In my last post, a commenter by the name of Chad (and didn&#39;t leave a link) <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2007/02/07/changing-blogging-style.aspx#comments">made a comment</a> to the effect that now I&#39;ll be blogging with &quot;quantity beating quality&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#39;t exactly agree.</p> <p>First, I am not a &quot;problogger&quot;.&nbsp; I am not trying to monitize my blog or push any products or anything.&nbsp; I <em>had</em> Google Adsense on it, though forgot to add it when switching to CS 2007 and haven&#39;t bothered to add it back yet.&nbsp; Blogging for money isn&#39;t my goal.</p> <p>Second, I am not on the level where my &quot;quality&quot; posts were some mind blowing technical achievements or anything.</p> <p>Instead, I see it more as something over nothing.&nbsp; Better to post <em>something</em> than to have my blog sit silent and&nbsp;unutilized.&nbsp; Plus, it will be more of my voice.&nbsp; I see something interesting, I&#39;ll post about it, rather than just keeping it all strictly CS or coding related.</p>
