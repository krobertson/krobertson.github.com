<p>Lately, I've been looking at the market for mp3s players.&nbsp; I've yet to buy one before, so I'm not yet committed to any of the services out there.&nbsp; However, I'm finding it difficult to fit a service + player to really fits what I'm looking for.</p> <p>In the player, there are a few things I want or plan to use it for:</p> <ul> <li>Video support... use it when I travel to watch a movie or some shows recorded on my Media Center  <li>30gb... enough space to fit enough of whatever I need  <li>Some way to interface it with my car, even just an FM transponder... that way I can take a better play list than my limited CD holder and 6-disc changer when I go to the Bay Area (where the radio stations suck)  <li>Good battery life</li></ul> <p>I will tell you right off the bat that the iPod/iTunes is out of the question.&nbsp; I had turned my wife onto iTunes and was going to be getting here an iPod Nano... iTunes awakened the inner music lover in her, leading to a lot of recent purchases, and some of the songs are ones we already have as regular mp3s or on CD that she just didn't know about.&nbsp; This kind of got me thinking.&nbsp; iTMS is not for us.</p> <p>What I want is a subscription service.&nbsp; Flat rate, covers all our musical tastes, various spurges, and everything.&nbsp; In my opinion, there are several advantages:</p> <ul> <li>When you "buy" a song, you never actually own it.&nbsp; You lose it, have to buy it again.&nbsp; So don't view buying a song as getting anything tangible.  <li>No need to build up your musical library with hundreds of dollars.&nbsp; It is all right there.&nbsp; It evolves with.&nbsp; It handles your splurges for the days when you feel like 80s music.  <li>Like entertaining guests?&nbsp; Always have the music you need for the occasion.&nbsp; No need to buy anything else.  <li>Have songs you like listening to only once in a while, and never often enough to want to "buy"?&nbsp; It is there whenever you want it.  <li>Have a wife who "buys" odd songs and goes on buying sprees?&nbsp; No extra costs as a result.</li></ul> <p>So I have my heart set on a subscription service above all.&nbsp; That completely eliminates any Apple product.</p> <p>Now, what about the <a href="http://www.zune.net/">Zune</a> that came out yesterday?&nbsp; Don't think it will be my answer.&nbsp; For starters, it uses it own <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/meetzune/zunemarketplace.htm">Zune Marketplace</a>, which only works with the Zune.&nbsp; My wife would prefer a smaller player, about the size of the iPod Nano.&nbsp; Can't get that with Zune Marketplace.&nbsp; Then I would need to pay for two subscription services.&nbsp; No thanks.&nbsp; The Zune <em>looks</em> cool, but I don't buy the whole "social" aspect.&nbsp; Having wi-fi is not really a selling point for me.&nbsp; So what advantage does it have?&nbsp; It certainly doesn't have compatibility.&nbsp; On top of the Zune Marketplace let down, it also requires its own software.&nbsp; Why not build on WMP11?&nbsp; No... had to create their own Media Player-ish program just for the Zune.&nbsp; I downloaded it and tried it... not impressed.&nbsp; First, it <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/meetzune/software/undetected_OS.htm">doesn't support Vista</a> (hello?&nbsp; brand new device doesn't work on their own brand new OS?) and even on XP, it was sluggish and locked up on me.&nbsp; It seems Microsoft took a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16855167008">Toshiba player</a>, made it incompatible with everything else, slapped together their own software, and went to market.&nbsp; In my opinion, they should have:</p> <ul> <li>Taken the Toshiba player (yeah, it looks good... works for a first gen)  <li>Made it compatible with <a href="http://www.playsforsure.com/">PlayForSure</a>  <li>Not write their own software for it, and never thought of Zune Marketplace  <li>Had it rely on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.mspx">WMP11</a> and <a href="http://www.urge.com/switch/index.jhtml?section=home">Urge</a> for the subscription service (especially since Urge is integrated with WMP11)</li></ul> <p>So this brings me to what my final decision will likely be.&nbsp; I will likely go with Urge, since it is right there in WMP11, which I already have.&nbsp; It works on Vista no problem.&nbsp; I think it may even work through Media Center.&nbsp; It supports tons of devices.&nbsp; And the devices range from regular palm sized to mini nano/pocket sized.&nbsp; I can get one my size and my wife can have her smaller one.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am leaning towards the <a href="http://us.creative.com/redirect.asp?id=1367">Creative Zen Vision:M</a>&nbsp;and think the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16855125012">SanDisk Sansa</a> would fit my wife best.</p> <p>Apple would have won if they had&nbsp;a subscription service... maybe someday.&nbsp; And perhaps the second generation Zune will look better... the device itself looks stellar, but looks like Microsoft made some bad decisions on the other details.</p>
