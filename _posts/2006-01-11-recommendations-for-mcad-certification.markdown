title: Recommendations for MCAD certification

<p>I'm starting to look into getting my MCAD this year, but don't really know which programs are the best.&nbsp; For starters, I am still torn between doing like a week long seminar and doing it at home at my own pace.&nbsp; The seminars cost more and would require more time off work, however it is gets it all taken care of.&nbsp; While the study-at-home programs code less and I could do them in my free time, they also take a lot longer.&nbsp; I have looked around some and there are dozens of different training courses and at-home study guide, and all of them say they are the best.</p>
<p>So if you have any recommendations for training programs that offer courses in or around Sacramento, CA or the Bay Area, please let me know.&nbsp; Also, if you know of any good at-home study programs, then please let me know about those as well.</p>
<p>Finally, anyone know when the programs will be updated for .NET 2.0?&nbsp; I have heard &ldquo;early 2006,&rdquo; but that is kind of general.&nbsp; I will probably wait and take the certification for 2.0, since it would be more relevant moving ahead.</p>
