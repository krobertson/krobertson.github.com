<p>Yesterday, I decided to start moving my photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.  Why?  One of the main reasons is a combination of two things.  With a Pro account (for only $2/mo), I can upload 2gb per month.  There is no fixed storage amount, so it constantly grows.  With this, it would be a great way to store all the photos that I don't post online as well.  Since I can mark them as private, I can easily upload all my other photos I don't want to make public so that they are safely off my system.</p>

<p>I've had it happen before where I accidentially lost photos from deleting them by accident, reformatting, hard drive failure, etc.  I don't have full redundant storage at home, and just want simple storage of my photos in a way that is easy to browse them when I want to.  Flickr makes that pretty easy.  All photos in one place, some public, some private.</p>

<p>One surprising thing, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/qgyen/">my photos on Flickr</a> look better than they did on <a href="http://qgyen.net/photos/">my own site</a>.  Then again, my site wasn't really designed with a gallery in mind... it is definitely more of a blog site.</p>
