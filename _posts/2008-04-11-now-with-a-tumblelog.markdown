<p>I now have a tumblelog as well: &nbsp;<a href="http://tumblr.invalidlogic.com/">tumblr.invalidlogic.com</a></p>
<p>Or linked in the title as well.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a couple people's tumblelogs since they're a great way to get quick little tidbits like links or the latest youtube crazes. &nbsp;I figured I'd start one for the stuff that is kind of in between Twitter and a blog post. &nbsp;It will likely be a mixture of quick technical links, pictures of my son (got to post those!), or just short random thoughts. &nbsp;In my effort to keep my blog more technical, the general stuff would likely be on my tumblelog.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> is a great platform for that kind of thing. &nbsp;Sure, <a href="http://graffiticms.com">Graffiti</a> could do it, as it is basically a blog with a very minimal theme, but Tumblr has great quick post methods to easily add a picture, video, quote, etc.</p>
