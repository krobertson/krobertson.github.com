<P>Today, <A href="http://www.iis.net">iis.net</A> launched.&nbsp; This will definitely be <EM>the</EM> source for information on IIS7.&nbsp; Going to watch <A href="http://www.iis.net/News/Item.aspx?i=1045">The .NET Shows on IIS7</A> later this afternoon.&nbsp; Ohh, by the way, the site is running Community Server. :)</P>
<P>Yesterday, the new version of <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">weblogs.asp.net</A> went live running CS v2.1.&nbsp; Chris Hammond <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/christoc/archive/2006/05/22/enable-communityserver-cross-posting.aspx">blogs about</A> how to syndicate posts from your blog to weblogs.asp.net.&nbsp; Think I may go ahead and set this up for my technical related posts, as my blog on there has been dead for quite a while.</P>
<P>Also, updated my own website to CS v2.1.60519.&nbsp; Still need to make a few skin updates, for things like my tag cloud.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll do that tonight while setting up syndication and watching The .NET Show.</P>
