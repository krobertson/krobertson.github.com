<p>Today&nbsp;I <a href="http://communityserver.org/blogs/videos/archive/2006/02/02/512894.aspx">made my instructional video debut</a>.&nbsp; Telligent has been getting infected by <a href="http://www.realnetworks.com/products/camtasia/">Camtasia</a> fever.&nbsp; First it was <a href="http://scottwater.com/default.aspx">Scott</a>, then it was <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward">Rob</a>, then <a href="http://photogblogs.com/blogs/jim%5Fmartin/">Jim</a>, and now me.</p>
<p>Camtasia really is quite useful though&hellip; and I think making short instructional videos for things like installing add-ons will be many times more useful than simply writing out instructions.&nbsp; Written instructions are still necessary, but all too often, people lose track of what they need to do, or can&rsquo;t find something on screen or in a config file.&nbsp; Having a video to simply show visually what they need to do is far more effective than telling them &ldquo;go here, click this, enter that&rdquo;.&nbsp; Jim has been using it on <a href="http://photogblogs.com/">Photogblogs.com</a> to show users how to use the FTP Server to upload to their gallery and how to include images in their posts.&nbsp; Makes it much easier to follow.</p>
