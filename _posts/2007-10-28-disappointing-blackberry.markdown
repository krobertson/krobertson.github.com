<p>I must say that this morning, I was rather disappointed in Blackberry that they still haven&#39;t straightened out the whole daylight savings system.&nbsp; I mean come on, you would have thought that was solved <strong>back in March</strong>.</p> <p>Woke up this morning, just like any Sunday, got ready, headed out to church, and then afterwards we went by Starbucks for some coffee and a bagel with my wife&#39;s parents.&nbsp; Before heading to Starbucks, I remembered hearing my father in law telling my mother in law that it was&nbsp;just after&nbsp;10am, which made sense since mass started at 9:15 (they are quick).&nbsp; But then while sitting in Starbucks, about to leave, I check what time it is on my Blackberry and it says 9:45am.&nbsp; I&#39;m like, ok, what the hell?&nbsp; My father in law looks at his phone and it says 10:45am.&nbsp; Now we&#39;re all confused.&nbsp; Which one is right.&nbsp; Did we change time today?&nbsp; No, no way we could have, we were on time to mass, we would have been an hour early if it did.&nbsp; Ok, so why did my phone decide to change today?</p> <p>Low and behold, 7 months after the whole fiasco with the new dates for daylight savings, Blackberry <strong>still seems to have missed the mark</strong>.&nbsp; Today was the normal day for the time change, however with the new dates, it is actually next weekend.</p> <p>This was a rather annoying flash back to March, when on the day the time changed, my less-than-intelligent phone didn&#39;t automatically update, so I had to manually set it ahead an hour, and then two weeks later, when the old date would have been, it jumped ahead another hour.</p> <p>And so now, I need to manually set my phone ahead an hour so that it remains accurate, and then remember to change it back again next weekend for the actual time change.</p> <p>I am rather disappointed that Blackberry doesn&#39;t seem to have gotten this resolved.&nbsp; Will I have to deal with this next year, <strong>assuming</strong> I still have this phone?&nbsp; I know the phone regularly downloads updates through the network, since I&#39;ve seen it wake up and restart in the middle of the night before (including once before a flight in the morning to Dallas, which made me nervous since I was using the phone as my alarm clock).</p> <p>Now I know this post will invite a bunch of &quot;get an iPhone comments&quot;... inevitably.&nbsp; I would like an iPhone, except: (1) only Cingular/AT&amp;T (can&#39;t make their mind up on who they are), and their coverage is not the best here, (2) no 3G, only EDGE, (3) from what I&#39;ve heard, it is a little underpowered.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ll get a 2nd gen, which by now is only&nbsp;6-8 months away.</p> <p>Until then, just be stuck with my Blackberry and bad daylight savings roll over dates.</p>
