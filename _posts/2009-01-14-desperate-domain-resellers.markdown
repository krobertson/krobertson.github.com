<p>This morning I woke up to this email waiting for me:</p>
<blockquote>From: xxx@googlemail.com<br />
To: me<br />
Subject: Regarding your domain name whobroke.us<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
I wondered if you would be interested in buying the .COM version of your domain name whobroke.us for $195 ? <br />
Let me know.<br />

<p>So I have this domain name, whobroke.us.  Last January I went on a domain-spree and thought it could be a political domain or something like that.  It is now pending expiration, since I never did anything with it.  But I get this email today from someone wanting to sell me the .com version.  Ok...</p>
<p>So I go over to GoDaddy just to look up the domain, and low-and-behold, the domain is available... I could get it for $9.99.  On the offchance, I though maybe he meant whobrokeus.com, so I looked it up and it is available as well. &nbsp;I sent him a reply, however I haven't heard back yet.  My guess is it is an automated script since a few hours after I emailed him, I received another message (the same one) from him again.</p>
<p>I guess domain resellers now are so desperate that they'll try and sell you readily available domains at a huge mark up.  Hey, someone agrees to buy it for $195, run out and buy it for $10, pocket $185!</p>
