<p>Pleased to announce that Trunks is live!  Head over to the new <a href="http://trunksapp.com/blog/">Trunks blog</a> for the <a href="http://trunksapp.com/blog/1-its-alive-">announcement</a>.</p>

<p>We are now open to beta requests and will be sending them out here and there.  I'm really wanting to progressively increase the number of users, rather than unleashing hell on it.</p>

<p>I've had everything <em>pretty</em> much ready to deploy since Friday, but then decided to wait until Monday, but then after doing the whole family pictures with Santa on Sunday night, was too pooped to write up the blog post and the final tweaks on the website.  Plus I was going to a concert last night.  Last night, finally got the last two things all done and everything was set for this morning.</p>

<p>So please head to the site, sign up to receive a beta invite, and enjoy!</p>
