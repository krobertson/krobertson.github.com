<p>Ater yesterday's post, I decided to create a new category for "Remote Workplace" related posts... things that relate to the average guy working from home.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is becoming more and more common for people to telecommute, but the ones you often hear of are the <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scobles</a> of the world, who travel around from conference/talk/client to client and always something new and fresh going on.&nbsp; Then there are the ones you don't hear about... the people who work from home, don't travel much, and whose day can be somewhat uneventful.</p>
<p>This new "remote workplace" series of posts will be geared towards the homebound workforce.&nbsp; It'll tips on keeping the day lively, getting out, going mobile without going far, and&nbsp;gadgets for mobility and working at home easier.&nbsp; Come to think of it, "going mobile without going far" is a good slogan for what the goal is.</p>
