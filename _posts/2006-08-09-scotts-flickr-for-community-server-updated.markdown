<p><a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/">Scott</a> had <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2006/07/20/Flickr-For-Community-Server.aspx">previously released</a> an add-on for Community Server that added a browseable list of images from a user&#39;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> account.&nbsp; As some people had noted though, it was incompatible with my <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/07/12/Lightbox2-JS-for-Community-Server.aspx">Flickr Lightbox module</a> because they used different versions of the FlickrNet library.</p><p>I&#39;d downloaded Scott&#39;s code for his module and took the liberty of updating it to use the latest build of FlickrNet, so that users can now make use of both modules side-by-side.&nbsp; Since Scott is going to be out of town on vacation, he&#39;d said he wouldn&#39;t mind if I went ahead and released, and so without further ado, please feel free to download it below.</p><p><a href="http://qgyen.net/r.ashx?4"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Download it now!</span></a><br /></p>
