<p>Since my download is now done, figured it is save to post about it.</p> <p>After lunch, decided to hop onto MSDN real quick and spotted that the Vista x86 RTM had been posted just a half hour earlier.&nbsp; So I ran on over and started my download!</p> <p>Just finished a minute ago, going to burn it to DVD, and then probably will install it a little later this evening.&nbsp; Got to finish up some work first.</p>
