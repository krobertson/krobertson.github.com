title: EC2 performance slopes
---

As I mentioned in my last post, we made the move off of EC2 in December to our own cluster of machines.

While EC2 had served us very well and helped get our systems to the place they are today, we started reaching a point where we were running into three main bottlenecks with the EC2 ecosystem and we couldn't find any way around them.


** Number 1: Network Latency **

Over time, our infrastructure has grown to more and more systems that are all interconnected and need to talk to teach other.

**Number 1: IO performance**

Probably the biggest
