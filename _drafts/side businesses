A few weeks ago, I had seen an article on Hacker News talking about how you should strive to start yout first businesses before you are married and have kids.

It struck a chord with me and something I find far from the truth.  When you aren't married and don't have kids, you have very little responsiblity so its easy to dive into startups and side businesses.

However, on the flipside, I've found that I am more decisive in how I spend my time as a result of being married, having kids, and far more responsibility than when I was younger.  Before, I was quite frivilous with my time.  I'd get a crazy idea for something, think it'd be awesome, and then spend and entire weekend on it only to then give up when the first real question needed to answered.

Now, I actually have a bit of a vetting process for an idea.  I put a lot of thought into it before I write the first line of code.  Some of the aspects:

* How interested am I in that market?  Is it a passion or just a "oo, that'd be cool".
* What are the parts of it that'd need to be built?  How much time would this probably take?
* How is it going to be deployed and what kind of costs would this bring it?
* Who is my market?  How will I reach them?  How much time/money would it take to reach them?  More important if it costs more to run.
* What is the support expectation?  If it goes down midday, how does it get resolved?
* If I have another project I'm into, which one am I more interested in?
* If its commercial, how will it be priced?  What kind of margin is there?
* Who are my competitors?  How do I differentiate?  What would draw someone to me vs them?

This is all pretty basic, but quite a few ideas end up as something cute, but not really worth my time.  When I finally started looking at things this way is when I decided for my hosting business to sit tight and not try not it up to everyone.  Sure I was into it, but it has too many X's against it.  This process also helped me to do Trunks.

Another important aspect is that not all ideas need to be approached as a yes or no.  There are several that are just a "not now," either due to resources, time, or other ideas I'd like to pusue first.

You don't need to be young to start a side business.

Instead with my side projects, I simply need to give them some thought up front before I jump into anything.  I know how much time I have available to work on them.  If I have an hour on the train or two hours before bed, I sit down to code knowing what I'm going to be working on and how much I want to do.  I know I want to work on it, that it is valuable, and it has scope.  I waste as little time as possible.

I hate starting on a project and then tossing it to the side, since I could have used that time on something else.  Before I write the first line of code, I'll think about what is involved in the idea.  It is small and simple, or quite large?  What does "usable" look like and what does "done" look like?  What else do I have going on how would I rank this?  If is to go commercial, what are the financials/costs/market/support/all that stuff?

When I was young, I rarely thought of these things.  I'd get an idea, spend all weekend hacking on it, then to realize it wasn't viable, hit a big road block, or suddenly relized the scope of it.

Not all projects are bad, just understand your time, understand your interestest, and make the best use of what you have available.
