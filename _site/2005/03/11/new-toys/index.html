  <p>Today is a day of new toys for me!</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/print_3100cn?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd">Dell 3100cn Color Laser Printer</a>:&nbsp;I finally got myself a decent color laser.&nbsp; After years of ink jets, I am done.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t print much, so often the ink would dry up or leak or get all used up the 1 time a year I print a photo.&nbsp; Also, the ink cartridges often cost more than the printer is worth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had printers break/die/make bad noises, soft often when I need new ink, I just get a new cheap printer (like the Lexmark Z605).&nbsp; Last January, they had a 30% off coupon for the 3000cn, but I waited too long to order it and it expired.&nbsp; So earlier this week, I found a 40% off for the 3100cn and hopped on it.&nbsp; Talk about nice&hellip; thing is damn big though.&nbsp; Should get a stand for it once I move.&nbsp; Finally got nice big paper feed, manual try for the occassional other stuff, built-in network card&nbsp;for network printing&hellip; nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.staples.com/Catalog/Browse/Sku.asp?PageType=1&amp;Sku=557894">Sealy Posturepedic Chair</a>: Previously, I&rsquo;ve always used <a href="http://www.staples.com/Catalog/Browse/sku.asp?PageType=1&amp;Sku=729699&amp;bcFlag=True&amp;bcCatId=0&amp;bcCatName=&amp;bcDeptId=2156&amp;bcDeptName=Task%2FErgonomic+Chairs&amp;bcClassId=142577&amp;bcClassName=Task%2FErgonomic+Chairs+%2D+Fabric+without+Arms">basic, armless task chairs</a>&nbsp;which are torturous on my neck/back.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve never gone all the way up to the back of my head, and I&rsquo;m always leaning back in them, which gradually bends them back, causing even worse back support.&nbsp; Plus, I always wear through the padding&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m down to feeling the bolts on my butt after about a year and a half to two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working at home now,&nbsp;I am at my desk nearly all day, so I am merely accelerating that process, and causing more neck/back pain.&nbsp; So I finally went out and got&nbsp;a nice chair that leans back, gives good support, and has arm rests (that alone caused most of my agony).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.uniden.com/productpop/00_productpop.cfm?prd_code=TRU8865-2">Uniden 5.8ghz cordless phone</a>: Living in an apartment, you are automatically in a major hotzone for a ton of 2.4ghz traffic.&nbsp; On my laptop, it easily detects about half a dozen wireless basestations from my room.&nbsp; All this was causing major annoyances when using my 2.4ghz phone at night.&nbsp; During the day, it worked pretty good, since then most people are gone to work.&nbsp; But at night, everyone is home and on the internet, and using the phone blows.&nbsp; Finally got a 5.8ghz phone since far less people using 802.11a than b/g.&nbsp; Now I just need to get past its 15&ndash;20 hour charge time.</li></ul>


<p>Yay, so bunch of new toys.&nbsp; Now to pick up all the boxes/packaging crap around my room and get back to work.</p>

      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
