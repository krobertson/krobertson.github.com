      <h2>Little shakening</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Just heard some startling news...</p>


<p>My old roommate and the best man in my wedding used to work at this small engineering firm in Sacramento.&nbsp; It was near the DMV Headquarters, so when I used to work there, I'd regularly go out to lunch with him and knew the owners of the company and all of the employees.&nbsp; We used to hang out with one of his coworkers, Peyton, fairly regularly.&nbsp; He'd come over to our house, gone out drinking with him, he'd crashed on our couch, etc.&nbsp; He was a nice guy, though was habitually late and unreliable (hence why he was eventually fired).&nbsp; He was also a little paranoid.&nbsp; One of those "got to pack and head to the hills" kind of guys.&nbsp; He used to ask me if I could hack the DMV and get him a new identity.&nbsp; He was a little out there, but seemed harmless for the most part.</p>


<p>Front page of the Sacramento Bee's Metro section today: <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/crime/story/13665449p-14508263c.html">Man fatally shot at workplace</a>.&nbsp; "Juan Menendez [think Peyton was his middle name] allegedly killed&nbsp; killed Ryszard Topor, 46, of Folsom in the lobby below the engineering firm where the men had worked, and walked away with a semiautomatic pistol in hand".&nbsp; Apparently later that day, SWAT raided his apartment and arrested him.</p>


<p>A little shakening.&nbsp; He didn't shoot anyone at my friend's old work, it was another place where he'd work for only a few months.&nbsp; But still... he was fired from my friend's old work... he could have done that then... and it could have been my friend.&nbsp; Even then, this was a guy I knew personally, I'd spent time with, and he'd crashed out on our couch numberous times.</p>


<p>You hear stories of people walking into their work and killing someone, and always think it they are just crazy, wacked out people.&nbsp; Kind of hits home when it is someone you know.&nbsp; Someone you though was pretty much harmless.</p>


<p>I didn't know anyone at his last job, though my prayers go out to the family.</p>
