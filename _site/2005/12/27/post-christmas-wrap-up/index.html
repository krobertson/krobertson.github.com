      <h2>Post-Christmas Wrap-up</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Kind of late, but thought I'd get in my "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year" post.&nbsp; This holiday season has definitely been a change.&nbsp; This is the first Christmas since Trish and I got married, so it was the first time doing things like getting our own Christmas tree, spending Christmas Day together, and so on.&nbsp; Previously, we'd always spent Christmas Day with our own families and stick to our own traditions.&nbsp; Now, everything is shifting as we now form our own set of traditions.</p>


<p>In terms of what old Saint Nick brought this year, I made out pretty well, especially in the wardrobe department.&nbsp; I think my wife rallied the troops as she had been dropping hints for a long time that I needed new pants, t-shirts, and such.&nbsp; As a geek, fashion isn't really my top priority.&nbsp; As long as something still fits, no stains, and no gaping (or noteable) holes, what's wrong with it?&nbsp; Well, leave it up to the holidays to replenish your clothing needs.</p>


<p>One piece of clothing my wife was excited about was this "<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/ladies/5981/">I Love My Geek</a>" t-shirt I got for her.&nbsp; She'd been dying to get a shirt like that for a while, and leave it up to <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek.com</a> to have it.</p>


<p>In terms of toys and gagets, I went out yesterday and bought myself a <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11154">Canon Digital Rebel XT</a>.&nbsp; I'd been wanting the camera for quite a while, and decided to take the plung and get it.&nbsp; So far, I absolutely love it!&nbsp; Has vastly more options that my previous camera, so still learning how to use all of the features.&nbsp; Read through the entire manual last night, and still playing around with it to get the hang of it.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
