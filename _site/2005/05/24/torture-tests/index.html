      <h2>Torture tests...</h2>

<div class="main">
  <P>Ever want to torture test yourself?&nbsp; Write some code to resolve a path.&nbsp; The biggest pain is handling of ".." and "." and intermixing them in ugly requests.</P>


<P>I've been working on updating the Community Server FTP Server to v1.1 and one of the weaknesses I'd found with the previous beta was some of its directory handling.&nbsp; For v1.1, the server is undergoing some major overhauling (mainly to make it pluggable to work with other apps that might use files/attachments in the future).</P>


<P>I thought I had everything working good, until I decided to try some odder requests.&nbsp; Like, if in /, typing "cd photos/sample/../sample/../../photos/" should result in changing into /photos/.&nbsp; You would think that it should be simple, but no.&nbsp; Had it scanning and counting occurrances of "..", but it was looking only for consequtive ones, and then removing them all.&nbsp; So it would count 2 occurrances (starts from the end back), and them remove the next two references.&nbsp; It wasn't paying attention to the fact that one of the instances it is removing might be another "..".&nbsp; So had to change it to check them while removing and not removing too much or too little.</P>


<P>Then I decided to start testing the "." current directory item.&nbsp; From /photos/, typing "cd ./../photos/sample/.././../" should result in /.&nbsp; But again, nope.&nbsp; When removing instances of "..", it was treating "." as a valid entry it should remove and count as occurance, when it should remove it and not count it as an occurance.&nbsp; Then you get into cases where you index gets out of range and you throw an exception before it has processed all of it.&nbsp; Oy.</P>


<P>In short, it has been a painful past two hours.&nbsp; I finally got it working and all of my test cases are passing.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; I've fired up the debugger so many times that Visual Studio has frozen on me twice.&nbsp; Just thought I'd share some excitement from my day.</P>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
