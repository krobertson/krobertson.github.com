      <h2>Tired of Comcast...</h2>

<div class="main">
  <P>I am getting so sick of Comcast.&nbsp; They reliability is down the tubes and I cannot stand it anymore, though there is no viable, more reliable alternative.&nbsp; I've had Comcast at a number of different places&nbsp;over the past few years and never had as many issues as I have been experiencing the past few months.</P>


<P>A short while ago, over the span of about a month and a half, Comcast had 3 major outaged (a couple hours or more).&nbsp; One outage lasted for over 12 hours, and the other two were within 2 days of each other!&nbsp; It went down for like 6-8 hours on a Friday, and then went down again for a few hours Sunday evening.&nbsp; When you work from home and everything you do is over the internet, you are severly crippled when your connection is down.&nbsp; When it went down twice in one weekend, on the first occurrance, I'd finally broken down and called Comcast to <EM>try</EM> and get an estimate for when it would be fixed.&nbsp; When I called, it had been down for at least 2-3 hours, but they'd said that the issue had just been reported like 45 mins earlier.&nbsp; Don't they have any monitoring systems in place?&nbsp; Does it really take them nearly 2 hours to find out that something went down?&nbsp; That's pretty sad.&nbsp; When it went down again 2 days later, I decided I'd call them like 20 mins after it went down and it was apparent it wasn't a small hiccup, and the guy didn't believe me.&nbsp; He was trying to get me to troubleshoot my modem (um, yes, I tried resetting it, I know what I'm doing).&nbsp; Then he wanted to schedule a truck to come out to my house.&nbsp; Finally I said "look, it is not on my end.&nbsp; I know my equipment, I tried doing it from here, something on your end died, and it dies frequently."&nbsp; All he could say was he'd open a trouble ticket and see if someone in their chat room will get to it... lame.</P>


<P>But now the thing that has been annoying me lately is DNS.&nbsp; From what I've seen, Comcast has never been able to keep their DNS servers working.&nbsp; Before, I used to have to switch my DNS servers on average about once a month.&nbsp; Change the secondary to the primary and primary to secondary.&nbsp; Since moving here, this has been about 1-2 times per week.&nbsp; During the past few days, I've been having to change it 3-4 times per day.&nbsp; I've tried looking at my stuff to see if it is my router or modem or anything, switching equipment out with some spare stuff, but still happens.&nbsp; Comcast just sucks.&nbsp; And I just need to stop using their DNS.&nbsp; It gets really frustrating... be cruising the net just fine when all of a sudden, stuff stops loading.&nbsp; Give a few, maybe click retry in case the server was busy or something, nope.&nbsp; Then I look over and MSN disconnects, but AIM is still connected (always happens when the DNS goes down, don't know why), and then Outlook disconnects.&nbsp; Open up the router management page and switch the DNS, boom, everything back to normal.</P>


<P>I have no faith in Comcast, but the only alternative here is DSL through Frontier Communications, who I've heared doesn't have an all too impressive record either.&nbsp; Where oh where is my good old SureWest fiber line?&nbsp; Man do I miss that.</P>

      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>

        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
