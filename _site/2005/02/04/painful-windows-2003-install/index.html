      <h2>Painful Windows 2003 install...</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Yesterday, I was tangled up in what has to be my worst Windows install ever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been wanting to put Windows 2003 on my desktop for a while, since I&rsquo;ve been doing more with multiple websites lately, and it is a pain to have to start/stop them multiple times during the day.&nbsp; I had found one solution that allowed multiple ones at the same time with a special extension, but its configuration seemed less pretty.</p>


<p>To make a long story short, it took me 8 hours just to get the system to boot the installation.&nbsp; The installation went fine, the first boot sucked.&nbsp; Since my PC has SATA and no floppy, I had to create a custom install CD with the drivers.&nbsp; No problem, done it before plenty of times.&nbsp; So did it, and then installed fine, but would just infinitely reboot when the &ldquo;starting 2k3&rdquo; screen came up.&nbsp; After <em>many</em> reinstalls, repairs, reburned CDs, finally tracked it down to the fact that the installer wasn&rsquo;t copying the INF file for the drive to the Windows\INF folder.&nbsp; Copied it, yay.&nbsp; Eight hours lost from one file.</p>


<p>Now tonight I am dog tired.&nbsp; Mind you, I started the install last night at ~7:30pm.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t get it to boot until shortly after 3am.&nbsp; Bed at 4:30am.&nbsp; Up for work/go back to installing at 8:30am.&nbsp; Yeah, I am going to bed early for once&hellip; damn, actually it isn&rsquo;t, its 2am?&nbsp; WTF!</p>


<p>Side note/question:&nbsp; Is Visual Studio 2005 going to come on DVD by default?&nbsp; I know beta1 did (though I got the CDs since I was downloading it from MSDN subscription)&hellip; but man do I hate installing Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; Six CDs and it takes so long.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
