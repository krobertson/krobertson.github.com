      <h2>Distributed workplaces and dependency on internet technologies</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>It became apparent to me today just how dependent people can get on technology in a work environment, and how difficult it can be to function when you are without it.&nbsp; Today, I was unable to connect to MSN Message from about 10am to 3:30pm PST.&nbsp; In an environment where your coworkers and clients are spread throughout the country, and IM is how 90% of your interactions occur, this kind of downtime can be detrimental.</p>


<p>During those 5 hours, it was almost as though I was lost.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t see if someone was online and ask them &ldquo;did we fix this&rdquo; or &ldquo;any ideas on how to do that&rdquo;?&nbsp; This morning we had a meeting with a client and the first thing that came up was &ldquo;has MSN Messanger been down for you?&rdquo;</p>


<p>It gets interesting when business is conducted and dependent upon technology and services that are basically free.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t pay for it, you don&rsquo;t have any uptime guaruntee, and there is nobody you can call and *** at when it goes down.</p>


<p>I think over time, as business gets more dependent on things like instant messaging, you&rsquo;ll start seeing commerial messaging services which guaruntee uptime and availability.</p>


<p>I thought I had more to write, but was writing this over the span of like an hour when doing other things.&nbsp; Doh.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
