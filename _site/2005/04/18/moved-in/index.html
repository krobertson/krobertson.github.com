      <h2>Moved in</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Moved into my new apartment over on Sunday and having fun unpacking and setting everything up.&nbsp; It takes far longer to unpack than it does to pack it all.&nbsp; It took me nearly all day to get the office, network, and my desktop back up.&nbsp; Mainly because I am quite particular about how I want everything laid out and wired up.&nbsp; Also because I keep forgetting things and having to run to the store.</p>


<p>At any rate, slowly getting things back in order and should be back at 100% capacity soon.</p>


<p>If you want to take a look at the place, <a href="http://www.qgyen.net/photos/category1060.aspx">check it out</a>.&nbsp; Pictures were from last week when Trish and I were painting it.&nbsp; It looks quite different now with things actually in it.&nbsp; Will have to take some more in a few days when the boxes are all put away and I don&rsquo;t have stuff strewn all around in the living room and dining room.</p>


<p>Ohh, and a note to anyone I work with, if I said I was going to send you something or something like that, please remind me or hound me until I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been kind of easily side tracked as I keep wandering off to unpack things as I realize I can&rsquo;t find something.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
