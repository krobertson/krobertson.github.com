      <h2>Game Addiction...</h2>

<div class="main">
  <P>Two weekends ago, I made the fatal mistake of going out and getting Star Wars Galaxies.&nbsp; I'd heard good things about it, and I liked some of the past Star Wars games (though I mainly played the first-person shooters), and it was relatively cheap ($30 for the game and 2 expansions, while most other games are like $50-55).&nbsp; Plus, my main motivation was that almost all TV shows are re-runs now, so nothing else to do at night.</P>


<P>Now, I can safely say I am addicted.&nbsp; I've never been into RPGs much (I think of the old telnet based textual RPGs), but the online multimedia ones are quite impressive.&nbsp; The combat is a little weak IMHO, since I prefer more first person shooters, where you click and fire where you want.&nbsp; In these, it more like click a target, click attack, and sit there and wait (simplified, but the basic jist of it).&nbsp; But then I went into the space missions... and that, I love.&nbsp; I've always like flight sims and such, plus in space, it is more of a first person shooter.&nbsp; Even more interesting if the abilities fully customize your ship with all different components with different properties.&nbsp; Amazing.</P>


<P>In short, I then went and created a new character, specializing in crafting (since I want to make the ships) and piloting.&nbsp; The game can take a long time to progress, but it is very interesting.&nbsp; As a developer, when I use different software, I often think about how I would design it or how I think it would work.&nbsp; A game like this just blows my mind at the complexity.&nbsp; You build stuff with resources.&nbsp; Resources have all different properties.&nbsp; The different properties determines the quality or extra boosts in what you build.&nbsp; Then that stuff performs better when being used.&nbsp; Or, that better stuff can make even better stuff that performs even better when used.</P>


<P>I've had to tone down some of my in-game time.&nbsp; As a crafter, it takes a lot of time to build up just gathering stuff and what not.&nbsp; So, I was leaving my computer on overnight to gather resources, and would have it in the background sometimes during the day.&nbsp; Well, yesterday, my video card had it.&nbsp; Switched over to the game yesterday and my computer locks up/reboots.&nbsp; Ok... go back into it, and all the 3D objects have gaps missing in them.&nbsp; Ok, computer is too hot maybe (it needed to be de-dusted), but it reboots again after a minute.&nbsp; After some trial/error on the game/drivers, find out the card has been permanently damaged.&nbsp; Luckily, my media center PC has the same video card, so I swapped them.&nbsp; The damaged one worked fine in 2D, and the media PC never does anything 3D, so I'm good.&nbsp; I am <EM>not</EM> going to be leaving my computer on in gam elike that again though.&nbsp; Going to have to find another way to build up. :)</P>

      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
