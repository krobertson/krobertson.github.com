      <h2>A fresh start</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>For a while now, I've been wanting to find a new domain name for my personal use. &nbsp;Previously, I was at <a href="http://qgyen.net">qgyen.net</a>, and have had that domain for about 8 years. &nbsp;It has all of my Google juice. &nbsp;If you Google for &quot;Ken Robertson&quot;, it is #1 (woot!).</p>


<p>The problem? &nbsp;Just try to pronounce it. &nbsp;It is just a word I made up, and made up on the computer. &nbsp;For a long time, I wasn't even sure how one would pronounce it... finally figured it was basically q-gen. &nbsp;But seriously, imagine you are out want to give someone your email address or your blog or something and you tell them &quot;go to q-gen.net&quot;.... the response is always &quot;q-what?&quot;</p>


<p>Sometimes I think I should just use my Telligent email address, since it is simpler, but I try to separate personal and work email as much as possible. &nbsp;Work stuff is usually more urgent stuff, and I don't want it to get dulled down by mixing it with personal email. &nbsp;Additionally, it doesn't solve the issue if I want to give out my blog address. &nbsp;I still get the &quot;q-what&quot;.</p>


<p>So I am starting fresh, and I have a goal: more technical content. &nbsp;I don't think I post enough technical content. &nbsp;Often times, always thing it needs to be very in-depth and insightful, but really, simple stuff and observations can be just as useful.</p>


<p>I also want to make a dedicated effort to actually release some public code. &nbsp;All of my older Community Server modules have kind of fallen behind, either lack of necessity due to adding stuff to the core or what, but I'd like to do more general purpose stuff rather than stuff product-specific. &nbsp;Plus putting code out there to the public is a good exercise. &nbsp;It helps others who might need something similar, it toughens your skin if it is critiqued, and builds confidence and comfort as often developers can feel embarrassed of their code. &nbsp;For someone who works mostly closed-source, showing your code is kind of like flashing someone.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
