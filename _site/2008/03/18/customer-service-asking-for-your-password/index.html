      <h2>Customer service asking for your password?</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>A while ago, I had signed up for just receiving an electronic copy of my cell phone bill.  So earlier this evening, I had been trying to log onto my Verizon Wireless account to look at last month's bill and was having some trouble logging.  Basically, I'd login but would get a "System Failure" message right when I log in and basically would be stuck.</p>




<p>So I call them and the customer support rep is walking me through logging in and they just weren't understanding what I was saying.  It went kind of like this:</p>




<p><ul>
    <li>Me: When I log in, it takes me to this 'System Failure' message</li>
    <li>Them: Well, when you first log in, do you see the sidebar which shows your phone?</li>
    <li>Me: No, I'm at a 'System Failure' message, their is no side bar</li>
    <li>Repeat above</li>
    <li>Them: Well, log out and close your Internet Explorer <i>(note: I didn't want to confuse them even more by being on a Mac)</i></li>
    <li>Repeat from beginning</li>
    <li>Them: Well, it shows our site is up and working, so it must be a problem with your server <i>(note: I really hate when non-technical people say that kind of thing)</i></li>
</ul></p>




<p>So eventually, they got the bright idea and wanted to try and log in as me, so they asked me for my username, which I gave, and then asked me for my password.  I was like <b>"Excuse me?  I am not giving that to you."</b>.</p>




<p>Had they never heard of <i>phishing</i>?  I was shocked that they even asked.  How many times have I read security notice emails about "we will <b>never</b> ask you for your password"?  Shouldn't that kind of thing be at the top of any customer service rep's <i>DON'T</i> list these days?</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>

        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
