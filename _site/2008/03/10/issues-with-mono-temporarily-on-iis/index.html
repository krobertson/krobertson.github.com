      <h2>Issues with mono, temporarily on IIS</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>I had <a href="http://qgyen.net/software/i-ve-got-mono/">previously mentioned</a> that I had moved my site over to Mono, however last night I actually moved it back to IIS.  The main reason is that I was experiencing some CPU spikes where Mono would take 100% of the CPU.  I had tried tracking it down over the weekend, though wasn't able to find the cause, and mean while, my site was going up and down as far as accessibility.  Since I wasn't able to narrow down the cause, and wasn't able to dedicate a whole lot of time to it just yet, I figured I might as well switch it back to IIS for the time being so I can get it resolved without having my site down, or having to go onto the server and kill/recycle the mono process.</p>




<p>Hopefully in the next couple of days, I'll get it nailed down.  I had a list of a couple of potential causes, and have crossed off a few of them.  This morning, think I might have figured it out, but haven't had a chance to test it yet.</p>

      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>

        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
