      <h2>Expressing your passion</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>How many times have you had a dialog like this:  I should blog more.  Well, what should I blog about?  I don't know, but I should blog more.  Though I don't want to sound boring, repetitive, or like an idiot.</p>


<p>There are probably two problems at work.  First, over thinking a simple problem.  Second, finding what you're passionate about and how to best express it.</p>


<p>There are a number of top notch developers who hardly blog, if at all.  But when they do, it is pure gold.  They speak more with code than on a blog.  You don't need jaw dropping libraries or masterpieces, but just useful stuff someone else might want to use or read.</p>


<p>Want to find who the true leaders are?  Find prominent people on Github and see what public projects they have.  You'll quickly find who is down in the trenches.</p>


<p>Having just gone to <a href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash 2010</a> last week, I am certainly reinvigorated.  Especially after <a href="http://objo.com/">Joe O'Brien's</a> talk on &quot;Refactoring the Programmer&quot;.  It was really spot on with so many aspects of the developer's lifestyle.  Some things I've taken aware include:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Scale back Twitter.  It is a time sink and I rarely <em>learn</em> anything in that time.</li>
    <li>Blogs are great, but scale back what I read.  All about finding the most value for the time.  Ignore banter and marketing.  Find others who show their passion in their writing.</li>
    <li>Write more code.  Practice makes perfect.  Athletes aren't just naturally talented, they practice and are learning continuously.</li>
    <li>Read more code.  Find good leaders, and learn what they've already learned.</li>
    <li>Read more books.  And not necessarily on coding, but on improving yourself overall.  Happiness comes from improving overall, not just in your profession.</li>
    <li>Go out on limbs.  If you put something out there, ask people to check it out and give some honest feedback.  If you have a question, seek out an expert and ask them.  Be clear in what you're asking, courteous of their time, and you'll likely get your answer.</li>
    <li>Reciprocate.  Asking for help is a two way street, so you need to pay it forward.  Forming connections goes a lot further than hoarding your time.</li>
</ul>


<p>My passion is in doing.  Nothing makes me happier than hacking away on some random idea until 1-2am.  And it is contagious.  It bleeds over into all that I do.  I put out better work during the day.  I'm glad to go to the grocery store before dinner.  I'm happier paying my bills.  I came out of CodeMash with a whole list of things to hack on and hopefully get even more to keep me invigorated until next year.  And hopefully I can throw the ideas out there, get some feedback, and create some value for others.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
