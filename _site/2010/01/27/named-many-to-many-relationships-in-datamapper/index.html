      <h2>Named many-to-many relationships in DataMapper</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>When implementing the collaborators feature in <a href="http://trunksapp.com/">Trunks</a>, ran into a bit of a roadblock with how to describe the relationships between the repository and the users.</p>

<p>Trunks is built on <a href="http://merbivore.org/">Merb</a> and <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a>, and the implementation involved two models: a User and a Project.  In Trunks, a repository is a Project because "repository" is a reserved attribute in DataMapper and I was running into issues early on, so I changed it to Project.</p>

<p>A project belongs to a user, and a user has many projects.  A user can also be a collaborator on many projects, and a project can have many collaborators.  So I already had the first relationship which was a simple 1-to-many relationship.  The problem came about with adding collaborators.  In a sense, it is a normal many-to-many, which you can do in DataMapper similar to how you would in ActiveRecord using a "has_many ..., :through =&gt; ..." relationship, but I was creating a relationship between models that had an existing and separate relationship.</p>

<p>I didn't want the user.projects collection to return the projects a user collaborated on, because it was intended to only be the user's own projects.  And similarly, a project only has one owner, not many.</p>

<p>I essentially found I needed a "has many through" with named attributes.  To do this, I had to actually create the proxy class that goes between the user and the project model, rather than let DataMapper create it automatically.  That way, I can control the attribute names on the proxy class so that "users" and "projects" on the two models won't get munged.</p>

<p>The result looked like this:</p>

<p>Having a "collab_users" on the Collaboration class allowed me to have the project model to get an attribute name "collab_users" instead of trying to use "users".  And on user, I could have "collab_projects" instead of mixing things up with the existing "projects" attribute.</p>

<p>When creating the relationships though, I had to be careful to spell out the actual parent and child fields rather than let them be automatic, otherwise it'll run into issues where it'll try to create 'collab_user_id' and 'collab_project_id' and inserts will fail because those columns aren't being set.</p>

<p>Take the relationship definition on the user model:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:collab_projects</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:model</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Project&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:child_key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:id</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:parent_key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:user_id</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:through</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:collaborations</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I am essentially saying create an attribute named 'collab_projects' through the 'collaborations' relationship.  'collab_projects' will be of type Project.  The child key on Collaboration is 'user_id' and the primary key on User is 'id'.  Here, the fields I specify are betwen User and Collaboration, not on Project.</p>

<p>Then on Collaboration, I have:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:collab_user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:model</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;User&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:child_key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:user_id</span><span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Here I tell it that the attribute on Collaboration will be collab_user, but the model it is linking to is User.  Basically saying I belong to user, but don't create an attribute named 'user'.  I set the child key, which is the column on Collaboration, to be 'user_id'.  I want to do that else it will try to create it as 'collab_user_id'.</p>

<p>Confused enough?  All boils down to having two separate relationships between two models and having control over what the attributes are named.  After all this, I end up with these calls:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby">  <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">projects</span>        <span class="c1"># the user&#39;s own projects</span>
  <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collab_projects</span> <span class="c1"># the projects the user is a collaborator on</span>

  <span class="n">project</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">user</span>         <span class="c1"># the owner of the project</span>
  <span class="n">project</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collab_users</span> <span class="c1"># the users who are collaborators on the project</span>
</code></pre>
