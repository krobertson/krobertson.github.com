      <h2>MSDN Subscriptions in reverse</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>I find it a little funny how MSDN Subscriptions seem to be fulfilled in reverse.</p>




<p>Back in February, I had signed up for an MSDN Subscription with Visual Studio Team Suite through <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/">Scott</a>.  They said it would take 6-8 weeks til I get everything.  So I waited about 6-7 weeks, and was expecting it anytime, but I had some problems with another package that was sent USPS.  So I contacted them to see if it has shipped yet and if it was by USPS, so that I could have them try to locate it as well.  They said it hadn't shipped yet and that they were behind on orders and it could take another 6-8 weeks.</p>




<p>Fast forward a little, and <a href="http://www.tankete.com/">Jose</a>, who registered his like a week after I did, already got all his stuff, but still I hadn't heard anything.</p>




<p>Then last week, out of the blue one morning, I get a package that contains the MSDN May Update.  Ohh wow!  Update CDs!  Wait, but what about the rest of them?  I get my update before I actually get the welcome package?</p>




<p>And then the next day, my welcome package finally comes with the binder and all of the CDs and I was happy.  But then I scratch my head for a minute... where are my product keys?  I hadn't yet received my subscription ID by email so that I could sign in online and get my keys.  So the CDs were basically useless.</p>




<p>And in a triumphant conclusion to the reverse-order-fulfillment process, last night I finally received my subscription ID by email last night and was able to get my product keys.  The thing I found most humorous was it said <em>"You should receive your first shipment within 7-10 business days."</em>  Um, nope, try that in reverse.  <em>"You should have received your first shipment 7-10 business days ago."</em></p>
