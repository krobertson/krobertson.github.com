      <h2>Origami not for me</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>After eagerly awaiting the announcement of the new "Ultra Mobile PCs" (aka, Origami) on Thursday, I was a little disappointed.  It has defintiely been over hyped and I am already sick of all the Origami/UMPC things everywhere.</p>




<p>I am just not interested in it.  I see it just has yet another device.  Sure, it would be cool and be great to show off to your friends, but I already have enough devices.  In my opinion, having a small, lightweight, but decently powerful PC is nice, but I want data mobility more than device mobility.</p>




<p>I look at it this way... I subscribe to a number of RSS feeds and like to read them at different times in different places.  So what I want is to be able to have an RSS aggregator on my desktop, laptop, and Pocket PC phone.  I want it to synchronize all the feeds I'm subscribed to, and share which ones I have marked as read or flagged.  Additonially, I do not want it to be web based, since I want to be able to use it offline.  Does this exist?  I haven't found.  FeedDemon 2.0 is close, but there yet.</p>




<p>Additionally, I look at the Origami how I used to look at having a separate cell phone and PDA.  A while ago, I had the cell phone for calls and the PDA for organization.  I quickly realized that the benefit of the PDA was lost because it was best when I always had it with me, but I did not want to carry two devices everywhere I went.  Thus, a Pocket PC phone/Smartphone combined two into one, making it a much better option.  What would an UMPC give me that is so crucial that my Pocket PC can't?  What would be so critical that my laptop or a tablet couldn't do?</p>




<p>The UMPC is bridging the gap between the laptops and the PDAs, but to make use of it in my daily life, it would mean carry three devices (PDA, UMPC, laptop) to get everything done, when I only really need two (PDA, laptop).</p>




<p>Perhaps the next generation will make it more attractive, when they are smaller, lighter, cheaper, but for now I think I will wait.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
