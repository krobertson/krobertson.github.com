<div class="main">
  <p>The <a href="http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/">Blue Angels</a> were in town over the weekend at the <a href="http://www.californiacapitalairshow.com/index1.html">California Capital Airshow</a> at Mather Air Force Base.  Below are a couple of the shots I took at the show:</p>

<p>Wish I had rented a super wide angle lens, like the Canon 10-22m, for the show since it would have been a lot easier to capture the entire plane with it.  It is interesting to walk around and see other peoples cameras and be able to tell roughly what kind of lens they had (at least the people with Canons, saw only a few Nikons).</p>




<p>One wish for future shows (which will probably never come true) is that they fire off real artilary.  They had 2 A-10 Warthogs there and flew one of them.  I was so hoping they'd fire off a couple of shots from its cannon, but they just did the lame thing where it flies over pretending to drop something and then firing off some pyrotechnics on the ground.  I want to see live fire!  Would love to hear its 30mm gatling gun in person.</p>




<p>Sadly, one of the most memorable parts of the day was the traffic.  This was the first time they've done an airshow there (at least in a very long time) and the traffic was very poorly handled.  On the way there, it took 2 hours to go about 2.25 miles from the freeway exit (where we met some friends for breakfast) into the base.  Then after the show, it took another 2 hours to get from the base to the freeway again.  Hopefully, if they have the show again, they plan the traffic better.  They had like 50,000 people leaving through one exit that was only two lanes.</p>




<p>Apparently, the crowd was even larger than they had expected, so hopefully the show comes back and they learn from the past on planning it.</p>
