      <h2>XV6700 in the house!</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Last night, I finally made the switch from my tried and true <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Audiovox_SMT5600/4505-6452_7-31138516.html">SMT5600</a> Smartphone with Cingular to the new <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/UTStarcom_XV6700/4505-6452_7-31660683.html">XV6700</a> with Verizon.&nbsp; The SMT5600 has served me well over the past year and a half, and it went a long way to help me realize the usefulness of PDA functionality within a phone.&nbsp; I finally was able to keep contacts, emails, and appointments all in sync wirelessly with our work Exchange server.&nbsp; If I was going to be out for a while, I could easily get online and check my messages and&nbsp;see what meetings I had coming up, but its abilities were limited.</p>


<p>For starters, the Cingular network is <em>so slow</em>.&nbsp; It was not very fast at downloading my messages or getting online.&nbsp; And I quickly realized that a keyboard was a huge limiter.&nbsp; Sure, it had the T9 work recognition, but in messages, you use a lot of technical terms which are never in its dictionary.&nbsp; So I was never inclined to respond to messages when I was away... it simply allowed me to check and made my get anxious to get home to my computer so I could respond.</p>


<p>Additionally, I've been a little bitter with Cingular since they screwed me after I got married.&nbsp; I used to be with Cingular Blue (aka AT&amp;T).&nbsp; When I got married and wanted to add my wife to my plan, they had to convert my plan over Cingular Orange.&nbsp; They <em>told</em> me my phone was unlocked (after a quick test with a Cingular SIM card and it seemed to work), however once they converted the plan over and tried to set up my phone, it wouldn't work at all.&nbsp; So I had to buy a new SMT5600, signing a new contract, and even though it was at a pretty decent discount, it left a bitter taste since I still had to pay something, and was then under contract.&nbsp; Additionally, once we changed over, my wife realized that Cingular's service is horrible around her work down in Lodi.&nbsp; She constantly loses a signal, gets dropped calls, etc.</p>


<p>Now, with me trying to get out more often (sitting in Starbucks as we speak), I realized my options for getting online outside of the house could get costly.&nbsp; For T-Mobile Hotspots at Starbucks, it is $6/hour, $10/day, or $30/month with a 12 month contract.&nbsp; And that is only at T-Mobile... if I go to a Java City (another chain around here) or a bookstore's coffee shop, it is a different WiFi provider, and then a separate fee.</p>


<p>It dawned upon me that I could use my cellphone to get online remotely though my laptop.&nbsp; However, Cingular's wireless network connections are barely faster than 56k dialup, so that is not even an option.&nbsp; However, Verizon's EV-DO network was very compelling.&nbsp; After checking out the XV6700 from Jim while I was in Dallas, I was convinced.&nbsp; EV-DO boasts a theoretical top speed of up to 2Mbps, with average speeds around 500kbps.&nbsp; Its not as fast as my cable modem at home, but certainly faster than dialup and very capable of handling basic web browsing, email, and IM.</p>


<p>So, I bit the bullet and made the switch.&nbsp; Purchased the phone, waiting fo rmy cancellation charge, but very content with the change.&nbsp; As I am sitting here in Starbucks, I&nbsp;did a speed test of the EV-DO service and got 462kbps down and 112kbps up.&nbsp; On top of that, the XV6700 features a slide out keyboard that makes responding to emails and even getting on MSN IM far easier than with the SMT5600.&nbsp; It also is a fully featured Pocket PC, which means in the future I could get a bluetooth GPS locator and navigation software (a new toy for sometime in the future... need goals, you know).</p>


<p>In my opinion, this service is almost a must for being truly portable.&nbsp; It enables me to get online anywhere I have cell service, regardless of who provides the WiFi hot spots or even if one is available.&nbsp; Even better, my monthly fees for phone minutes and unlimited data is only a few dollars more than with Cingular... much less than Cingular + T-Mobile Hotspots would be a month, with much more availability.&nbsp; What more could I want?</p>
