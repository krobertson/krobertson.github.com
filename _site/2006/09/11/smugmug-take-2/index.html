      <h2>Smugmug, take 2</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>In light of <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/09/10/Flickr-not-happy_2C00_-Smugmug-slow_3F00_.aspx">my post yesterday</a> regarding <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">Smugmug</a>, thought I would post a follow up.</p>


<p> <p>First, I am impressed that the CEO of Smugmug, <a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/onethumb/">Don MacAskill</a>, commented on my post yesterday, mentioning that they were having issues.&nbsp; Hey, issues do happen, and Flickr is just as guilty, since I was having problems with them yesterday, and I remember back in like July when they were down for nearly a full day.&nbsp; Smugmug's issues yesterday weren't as bad as I've seen with Flickr, it just didn't make for a great first impression.</p> <p>I am going to continue to check out Smugmug though, since I had been meaning to write a Smugmug Lightbox module for CS to accompany my <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/08/09/Improved-Lightbox2-JS-for-Community-Server.aspx">Flickr Lightbox module</a>.&nbsp; Hopefully their web service API is prettier than Flickr's (haven't looked at their yet, but Flickr's is too big).&nbsp; That piece aside, I am impressed with some of the customizations and theming you can do with Smugmug.&nbsp; Don't get anything but the stock layout on Flickr.&nbsp; They also seem to have a very active community, though in a different way than Flickr.&nbsp; Flickr is mostly a photo community, where Smugmug has an accompanied forums site.</p> <p>The biggest thing that impresses me is that Don found my post and took the time to comment on it.&nbsp; That right there <em>could</em> convince me to switch.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I like companies that are in touch with their userbase.&nbsp; Brad, the CEO of <a href="http://www.clearcontext.com/">ClearContext</a>, had commented when I've mentioned them.&nbsp; The person who wrote <a href="http://youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a> got back to me when I posted about their product on another blog (what, I have more than one blog?&nbsp; yes).&nbsp; The CEO of Flickr or anyone there hasn't posted on my blog before.&nbsp; As a user, it is always nice to know your opinions (good and bad) are heard, so it is nice to see companies that keep their finger on the pulse of the community.</p> <p>On a side note, the name Don MacAskill sounded familiar when I saw the comment.&nbsp; With a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Don+MacAskill">Google search</a>, I saw that he goes by "onethumb" which rang a bell.&nbsp; I remembered that name from back in '96-97, because he worked at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961121191025/http://www.best.com/">Best Internet Communication</a>, my old old old ISP.&nbsp; Best had a pretty active set of community newsgroups, and I remember him as one of the administrators.&nbsp; Then I remember running across his name for working with the guys at iD Software back around Doom 2 / Quake, and then again at Ritual Entertainment for SiN.&nbsp; Damn, that was a long time ago.&nbsp; That was when I used to use the screenname 'SeaDawg'... wow.</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
