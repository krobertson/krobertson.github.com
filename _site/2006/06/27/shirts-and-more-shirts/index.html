      <h2>Shirts and More Shirts</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Tonight, I went to the <a href="http://www.sacdotnet.org/sacdnug/index.aspx">Sacramento .NET User Group</a> and saw <a href="http://www.mcwtech.com/CS/blogs/keng/">Ken Getz</a> talk on WinForms Tips &amp; Tricks (who coincidentally uses CS, though I didn't get to talk to him afterwards since he had to leave right after it).  Anyway, right after the meeting, they had this raffle for a couple prices and I won myself this nice little shirt:</p>

"Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life."</p>




<p>I thought my wife would laugh at it, but she wasn't extremely amused.  She was like "our kids aren't going to be mistakes!"  No, of course not, babe.  But it is a funny shirt. :)</p>




<p>And for those of you who are in the Sacramento/Bay Area, you should keep your keep your schedules free for either August 29th or September 26th (likely the August date) as I will be presenting at the Sacramento .NET User Group on Implementing Windows CardSpace, covering what CardSpace is, types of applications, a demonstration of a live site utilizing it, and a walk through of how to implement it in your own applications and sites.  A part of the demonstration will cover CardSpace integration Community Server!  More to come on that in time. :)</p>

These are a hot commodity and I only have a very limited supply.  So if you want one, be sure to come out!</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
