<p> <p>I've noticed coffee gives me a different kind of buzz compared to other things like soda.&nbsp; Sodas, like Mountain Dew, don't have nearly as much of an impact on me.&nbsp; Perhaps coffee as more caffeine than them, but soda has never quite done it for me, unless I drink a ton of it.</p> <p>Energy drinks, on the other hand, can really get you wired, but then you wind up way down in the afternoon.&nbsp; In the past, I've had the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/">Caffeine Sampler Pack</a> from ThinkGeek (they no longer carry it), which was a wide assortment of caffeinated products.&nbsp; The drinks are packed with caffeine.&nbsp; You know it has a lot when some of the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/drinks/2818/">drink's</a>&nbsp;labels mention "Warning:&nbsp;This drink contains high levels of caffeine."&nbsp; The downside is that when it wears off, my energy takes a nose dive.</p> <p>So getting back to coffee, it is a nice balance between the.&nbsp; Gets me going to get stuff done, and then I'll usually end up taking a late lunch (suppresses appetite some) and a little power nap after eating, then back to work, without much of a downfall.</p> <p>One problem though is that caffeine can sometimes make you a little goofy.&nbsp; See, I work remotely, so I am pretty much home alone all day.&nbsp; So I really have no reason to appear normal while working at home.&nbsp; I won't get any glances from someone in the next office or anything.</p> <p>Anyway, just killing time while waiting for a response on an email.&nbsp; Yes, I am caffeinated right now.&nbsp; Moving too fast to be able to stop.</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
