      <h2>Usability is design</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Today, both <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/archive/2006/11/01/Which-is-more-difficult_3F00_.aspx">Rob</a> and <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/do-not-forget-the-user-experience.aspx">Scott</a> blogged about designing for usability compared to designing for scalability/performance.&nbsp; I I completely agree with Scott&#39;s opinion, that developers are too concerned about the code instead of the usability.</p>


<p> <p>Scott talked about how in the <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2006/10/30/My-Programming-Manifesto.aspx">Programming Manifesto</a>, there is no mention of usability.&nbsp; In my opinion, usability design and architectural design are often seen as two separate things.&nbsp; That is way off base.&nbsp; Usability is a part of all design.&nbsp; <strong>Usability should always influence architecture.</strong>&nbsp; Usability should always impact your coding.</p> <p>One place where I would make this point is with something like error handling.&nbsp; Error handling is likely in anyone&#39;s list of &quot;best practices&quot;.&nbsp; However, it is also very important for usability design.&nbsp; Say you are connecting to a remote web service with user supplied credentials.&nbsp; There are variety of types of errors, that should be handled in different ways.&nbsp; Errors should always be caught, but where?&nbsp; What kind of error logging do you use, what types of errors do you log?&nbsp; For God&#39;s safe, avoid empty catch { }&nbsp; blocks unless you know for certain it is what is best.&nbsp; What are system errors and user errors?&nbsp; Say you are able to connect to the web service, where is that caught?&nbsp; How is it logged?&nbsp; What does the user see?&nbsp; Say the credentials are wrong, how is that handled?&nbsp; Say there is a serialization error in the transaction, how is that logged?&nbsp; Can it be recovered from?&nbsp; What is the user told?</p> <p>Your code should always be designed around providing a solid user experience.&nbsp; That means error handling, checking for null variables or empty strings, and all aspects.</p> <p>Another distinction to make is what is &quot;simple to use&quot;?&nbsp; Who is it &quot;simple to use&quot; to?&nbsp; For starters, <strong>common sense does not exist</strong>.&nbsp; Jason Jennings quoted it best in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Big-Act-Small-Performing/dp/1591840767">Think Big, Act Small</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;Remember, the most common thing about common sense is how uncommon it is.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p><strong>What makes sense to one person does not apply to another</strong>.&nbsp; What makes sense to one <em>group</em> of users will not apply to another.&nbsp; Usability should be thought of as far as designing for your grandmother, mother, or some other non-techie user.&nbsp; Usability should be designed to the context of your target audience.&nbsp; If you target user is non-techie, design for a non-techie user.&nbsp; If your audience is a group of experienced project managers, design for them.&nbsp; What would make sense to them?&nbsp; That is &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; for them?&nbsp; I used to work on a legislative cost estimating database.&nbsp; This was pre-Web 2.0, but post-Web 1.0.&nbsp; The application was no golden gem of usability, however while designing the actual pages, we spent literally a full two weeks in all day usability meetings.&nbsp; We&#39;d focus on:</p> <ul> <li>Who is going to see this page?  </li><li>What read-only data is most important to them?  </li><li>What editable data is most pertinent?  </li><li>How should pieces of information be grouped?  </li><li>How should the various groups be arranged?</li></ul> <p>We milled over all of those aspects for each and every page in the application.&nbsp; The people using the application were going to be living it.&nbsp; Non-techie users aren&#39;t going to be using it, so designing for them would be counter productive.&nbsp; We would go over the pages in the morning session, then after lunch I would scamble to make the changes we&#39;d discussed, and then go back for the afternoon session with the revised screens to continue going over them.<br /></p> <p>I don&#39;t remember where I read it (couldn&#39;t find it), but someone had said that coders make for bad testers because coders will cope with the bugs.&nbsp; They can figure &quot;ohh, I&#39;ll get to that later&quot; or find some workaround to it that works for them, but no one else.&nbsp; The same is true for usability.&nbsp; <strong>Your common developer is not necessarily the best for usability design</strong>.&nbsp; If your audience is a non-technical user, then a technical user developing it won&#39;t exactly know the best way.&nbsp; How can you work around this?</p> <p>First, a usability conscious developer should be able to step outside of their context to find the flaws in their design.&nbsp; Use the software!&nbsp; Sit back and take a second to think about what makes sense, and what doesn&#39;t make sense.&nbsp; Second, get it out to multiple people, technical and non-technical.&nbsp; The more eyes the better.&nbsp; One key to look for is people who can look at it critically and make some suggestions as far as what is wrong, or what might be better.&nbsp; Finally, give it time.&nbsp; It will take many iterations.&nbsp; Sound usability does not happen overnight or on the first iteration.</p> <p>A final point is that usability design fits in perfectly with agile development.&nbsp; Usability takes time.&nbsp; Come up with something, send it out to a few people to try out and solicit suggestions.&nbsp; Discuss them.&nbsp; Try it out.&nbsp; You may accept it, you may go back, or you may try something else.&nbsp; The point is, <strong>get something up early and as you develop, continue to address the usability</strong>.</p> <p>Both Scott and Rob make totally valid points.&nbsp; At Telligent, we are guilty of many usability sins.&nbsp; We used to be all about the code, however as Rob says, designing for usability is much harder.&nbsp; It is difficult to change your mindset and turn things around, however it gets progressively better over time.</p> <p>.NET world very big about the code and methodology.&nbsp; Why is the iPod a golden gem?&nbsp; Why is everyone talking about <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>?&nbsp; They focus on the user experience, and they don&#39;t necessarily neglect the background technology, but they recognize what is most important to their customer, the target audience.</p> <p>(In case you were wondering, I have been starting to make my main points bold.&nbsp; I am a huge fan of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood&#39;s blog</a>, and I like how he does it.)</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
