      <h2>Xmas Light Mania 2007 (yes, 2007)</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Since Christmas is now upon us, it is time for that age old tradition: Christmas lights!&nbsp; When I was younger, my dad and I used to deck out the house with tons of lights.&nbsp; It was always a lot of fun (for me, maybe not him... he always pulled that "I'm too old for this blah).&nbsp; Now my dad doesn't do nearly as much, since all their kids have moved out.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;Trish and I&nbsp;just in an apartment, we can't do much at our place, though that doesn't keep me from dreaming of the day or enjoying other displays.</p>


<p> <p>To get myself in the mood for 2006, I was checking out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Gt-jbrC1o">computerized light show to TSO's "Wizards in Winter"</a> from last year.&nbsp; I was showing it to Trish and then she said the fateful words that ignited a fire: "we should do something like that."</p> <p>And thus, my quest to have something for the 2007 Christmas season shall begin.&nbsp; Why 2007?&nbsp; Because next year, we'll be in a house instead of an apartment, and the displays are quite elaborate, so can take time to develop.&nbsp; Also, I am going to go the geekier route:&nbsp;do it yourself!</p> <p>There is a company called <a href="http://www.lightorama.com/">Light-O-Rama</a> that makes the hardware and software for the computerized displays.&nbsp; They have a nice <a href="http://www.lightorama.com/Videos.html">video collection</a> of people using their products.&nbsp; They are a little expensive though.&nbsp; I know I would one day love to have one of the very elaborate displays, so some things like their 128 channel package run $2,500.&nbsp; Even their base 16 channel controller is $330 each, or 8 channel for $220 each, and the software is $100.&nbsp; Even their hobbyist kits (minus the enclosures) are $210 for the 16 channel and $100 for the 8 channel.&nbsp; Being the geek I am, I know I could build my own for far cheaper, and have&nbsp;far more fun doing it.</p> <p>My idea?</p> <p>Almost the same as how they are doing them.&nbsp; Design a very simple mini-controller device that uses a series of solid state relays to turn different channels on/off.&nbsp; It would be controlled by an embedded processor and receive commands over ethernet.&nbsp; Using a network, the range of lights is easily scalable.&nbsp; Also, to avoid the overhead of using a full TCP/IP stack, would likely drop down to using UDP or maybe even raw ethernet headers.&nbsp; The mini-controllers would receive very basic "toggle channel 1" or "toggle channel 2" commands, so there isn't a lot of processing.</p> <p>The show would be controlled by a main controller that issues commands to all of the mini-controllers.&nbsp; Initially, it would be a PC, though I could eventually move it out to an embedded device working along side a hardware MP3 decoder for synchronization, and a RTOS (Real Time Operating System) for issuing the commands.</p> <p>For the software, I'd write some sort of storyboard software.&nbsp; Similar to how video editing software works, would have something like "turn on channel 1 at 2000ms for 100ms, turn on channel 2 at 2050ms for 100ms", etc.&nbsp; Maybe even one day software that lets me design it along side the MP3.&nbsp; Then the program would translate the series of sequences into a single series of commands.&nbsp; I'd like the timer like feel of "turn on for 100ms" rather than having to think of it like "turn on at 2000ms, turn off at 2100ms".&nbsp; But the translator would look at the storyboard and come up with the needed commands.&nbsp; Have it see "sleep 2000ms, turn on 1, sleep 50ms, turn on 2, sleep 50ms, turn off 1, sleep 50ms, turn off 2".</p> <p>My goal would be to have the hardware and software designed for Christmas 2007 and have just a very basic display.&nbsp; No music, but some computerized sequence that just loops.</p> <p>Though there are a few design details on my mind:</p> <ul> <li>Biggest question of all: shall I go <a href="http://microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=64">PIC</a> or <a href="http://www.atmel.com/">AVR</a>?&nbsp; Both have free C compilers, both have cheap development kits with ethernet (~$50), both have active hobbyist communities.&nbsp; Still torn here.</li> <li>Will be dealing with AC current... prototyping and dealing with AC current?&nbsp; Not looking forward to it.&nbsp; Hope I don't electrocute myself or burn the place down.</li> <li>Going to need a sealed enclosure for the device, so would need to figure that out as it will greatly affect how the hardware comes out.</li> <li>PIC or AVR?&nbsp; Damnit!</li></ul></p>

        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>

        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
