      <h2>Bye bye Vonage</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>I think I have finally had it with Vonage.  Over the past few weeks, their service has been incredibly unreliable for me.  It will work one
day, then not the next, then it will work for a few days, and then down
again.  Come on!  It shouldn&#39;t be my Vonage unit.  It is only two years
old, things haven&#39;t changed that much, and it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense
it would work for a while and then not.  Between it not working and
working, I haven&#39;t been power cycling it (though I have tried).  I&#39;d
tried adjusting it with my local router, but it makes not difference.<br /></p>

<br />


<p>I&#39;ve been a loyal Vonage user for over two years now and never had a
problem, but lately, I am rather disappointed.  Vonage is no longer the
deal it once was.  Their prices are still the same as they were two
years ago, but the VOIP industry has greatly advanced.  $25/month for
unlimited calls, or 500 minutes for $15 (the plan I&#39;m on)?  That just
doesn&#39;t feel like a deal anymore.  Especially when on average, I only
use 100-200 minutes a month.  I could easily fit that in on my cell
phone (where I hardly use all the minutes I have).<br /></p>

<br />


<p>I&#39;ve been switching to Skype for a number of daily work related calls,
since it is mostly to call into a conference line or chat with someone
directly over Skype.  Think it is time I finally dump Vonage and just
switch to Skype full time.<br /></p>
