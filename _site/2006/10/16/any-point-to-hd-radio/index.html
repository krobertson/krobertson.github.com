      <h2>Any point to HD Radio?</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Is there really any point to the new <a href="http://www.hdradio.com/index.php">HD Radio</a> rave?&nbsp; I mean, please give me a solid reason why I should care.&nbsp; I am tired of all the stupid HD radio commercials, and I am hardly ever in my car to be able to hear them.</p>


<p> <p>First, I have a stock deck.&nbsp; I like my stock deck.&nbsp; It integrates very nicely with the styling in my car.&nbsp; I don't want to change it.&nbsp; Is HD radio supposed to so outstanding it would motivate me to buy a third party deck, leaving behind the nice flush integration?&nbsp; No.</p> <p>Second, third, fourth, and fifth (because it is a big reason), all the radio stations around here <em>suck!</em>&nbsp; All the radio stations when I go into the Bay Area <em>suck!</em>&nbsp; They all have lame DJs, tons of commercials, small service area, or play the same played out music.&nbsp; The content of the stations is horrid.&nbsp; They always have the "listen to us in HD radio... ooooo ahhhh" plug.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; So I could listen to all their commercials in "HD"?&nbsp; Get a 3 minute song, 10 mins of commercials, and then 10 mins of some DJ running his mouth?</p> <p>Honestly, as your average consumer, I see absolutely no motivation to buy an HD radio.&nbsp; On the flip side, I could totally go for satellite radio.&nbsp; My main reason for not getting it is because on average, I hardly drive.&nbsp; Though whenever I go into the Bay Area, I find myself wanting it more and more.</p></p>
