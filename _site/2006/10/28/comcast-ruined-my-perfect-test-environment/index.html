      <h2>Comcast ruined my perfect test environment</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>I hate Comcast.&nbsp; I've <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2005/09/23/1102.aspx">posted before</a> about how much I dislike them.&nbsp; Now they've gone and ruined my ideal testing environment.</p>


<p> <p>I am a total fan of using virtual machines.&nbsp; I spin a new one up whenever I have a new piece of software to test in an environment other than my own, or if I want to try out some software before installing it on my desktop.&nbsp; I have a nicely equipped server specifically for virtual machines.&nbsp; I use VMware Server running on top of Windows 2003.</p> <p><a href="http://qgyen.net/images/Comcastruinedmyperfecttestenvironment_A091/vmware18.png"><img style="border-right:0px;border-top:0px;margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;border-left:0px;border-bottom:0px;" height="163" src="http://qgyen.net/images/Comcastruinedmyperfecttestenvironment_A091/vmware_thumb14.png" width="320" align="right" border="0"></a> Earlier this week, I had an idea for tweaking it out to be the ultimate test environment.&nbsp; I could install a mail server on it and add an MX record to my DNS for *.subdomain.qgyen.net, that way I could run lives tests on things like Mail Gateway.&nbsp; And on top of that, I could have the server run ISA Server and easy make sites on the various virtual machines publicly accessible.&nbsp; It know that when it receives a web request for test1.subdomain.qgyen.net, to redirect it to the proper internal virtual machine.&nbsp; It was working delightfully.</p> <p>Then Comcast laid the smackdown on me last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't gotten any confirmation, but around 7pm, my connection went down.&nbsp; Finally, after a couple of hours, I started getting intrigued and was messing around.&nbsp; The cable modem showed it had a full signal, however it wouldn't pair up with the public network card.&nbsp; So then I switched it back to my old Linksys router with DD-WRT, and it works flawlessly.&nbsp; Go back to my server, nothing.&nbsp; Arg!</p> <p>So after 3 days of utilizing the server for some testing, mostly doing some test emailing, Comcast decides to block it?&nbsp; What gives!&nbsp; Heck, years ago, I used run my entire domain from my home server.&nbsp; Email, website, and all.&nbsp; And they never blocked me.&nbsp; Now, maybe a couple of dozen emails over a few days and I get blocked.</p> <p>I could do the same set up for email with DD-WRT no problem, but don't know about making the websites accessible (unless I did them using port translation).&nbsp; But even then, I think I will try to get some confirmation from Comcast before I do, since if they block my Linksys router, then I am really going to be pissed.&nbsp; I hate Comcast.</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
