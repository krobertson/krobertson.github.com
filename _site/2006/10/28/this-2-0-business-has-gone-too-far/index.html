<p> <p>I think the local government guys often times get a little bit more creative.&nbsp; They aren&#39;t noticed as much, so they have to do things to stand out a little more.&nbsp; With the mail today came this flyer for this guy Patrick Hume, running for <a href="http://www.elkgrovecity.org/">Elk Grove City Council</a>.&nbsp; In big, bold letters it said &quot;<strong>Elk Grove City Council: Leadership 2.0</strong>&quot;.&nbsp; I instantly rolled my eyes... now politics is making a play on the &quot;Web 2.0&quot; buzzword.</p> <p>Our of sheer curiosity, I decide to flip it open to read something to the tune of: (I threw it out, so going from memory)</p> <blockquote> <p>I have been a small business leader for the past X years.&nbsp; Over that time, I&#39;ve learned two important lessons: to change with the times, but to not forget the fundamentals.</p> <p>Our City Council has failed on both of these.&nbsp; I&nbsp;represent new leadership.&nbsp; Leadership 2.0.</p></blockquote> <p>[speechless]</p> <p><img align="right" height="120" src="http://qgyen.net/images/This2.0businessgonetoofar_FCDA/hotpad_thumb5.jpg" width="108" />I do have to hand it to his campaign crew though... they are creative.&nbsp; While it may make me roll my eyes, it is fairly creative.&nbsp; And he&nbsp; has some pretty good tactics.&nbsp; A couple of days ago, we get some mail from his campaign.&nbsp; It is a letter that is supposedly from his mother urging people to vote for her son.&nbsp; It even included a free hotpad!</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
