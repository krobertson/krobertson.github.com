      <h2>XV6700 ROM Upgrade, bye bye everything</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>A couple of days ago, I decided to upgrade the ROM on my Verizon XV6700.&nbsp; I'd heard that the latest ROM introduced some new fixes, added the ability to lock the screen, and, most importantly, introduced the new push email support when using Exchange.</p>


<p> <p>So I had downloaded the ROM and the instructions on upgrading, but either I completely missed the note, or they just neglected to point it out, but it completely wiped everything off of it.&nbsp; Gee thanks!&nbsp; All the programs I had installed, all the tweaking I'd done on my home screen, my top scrores in solitaire, all gone.</p> <p>If they had pointed out that it would erase everything, I wouldn't have cared.&nbsp; I would have just downloaded the latest versions of my programs and saved the latest version of some of the configuration files for my home screen widgets.&nbsp; But no... I&nbsp;figured it would reset everything, but not erase everything I had saved.&nbsp; And unfortunately, I didn't have copies of the files on my miniSD card... only on the ROM itself.</p> <p>So, for anyone else looking to upgrade the ROM, and a note to myself for the future, <em>back up your stuff before upgrading!</em></p></p>
