      <h2>Looking back...</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Lately at Telligent, we&rsquo;ve all been heads down working on hammering out fixes for the final remaining high priority issues in order to get us towards the RC stage for Community Server v2.0.&nbsp; It brings back memories of when we were hammering out fixes for the v1.0 release.&nbsp; We had some external people doing some heavy testing, and they would report tons of issues (some relevant, some not).&nbsp; We&rsquo;d be working on items all day, and put a good dent in the count, only to wake up the next day and find&nbsp;like 7&nbsp;new issues reported.&nbsp; We were stuck in the teens for the longest time and people were constantly updating their MSN personal messages to the current count.</p>


<p>Ahh, the early days&hellip;</p>


<p>Now, things are somewhat more streamlined.&nbsp; Most the major issues have been in the system and we aren&rsquo;t getting a whole lot of new additions each day (which is good).&nbsp; You still get that anxious feeling when you log into the issue tracker, fire of the query for Open | v2.0 | High | Urgent, then scroll down to see the number of records returned.</p>


<p>I kind of miss the v1.0 days.&nbsp; We would release a beta and I would be pinned to my chair all day logging a flood issues that came in, checking in fixes left and right.&nbsp; Release days would certainly keep you busy.&nbsp; Now, CS is a pretty stable platform, and there isn&rsquo;t really a flood of issues anymore.&nbsp; Mail Gateway sometimes gets a quick surge of issues from our testers, but it is starting to head down that home stretch for RTM as well.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
