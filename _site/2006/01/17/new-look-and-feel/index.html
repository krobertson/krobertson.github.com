      <h2>New look and feel</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>You may have noticed now that there have been a few changes to my site lately.&nbsp; For one, I dropped my old layout and a number of the pages that it had.&nbsp; I did this primarily because I&rsquo;d like to stay more up-to-date with my CS builds, but it becomes difficult to do a new build and then integrate it into my site.&nbsp; Additionally, the code for the old layout was pretty horrid.&nbsp; I never dared to run it through any validators.</p>


<p>So now, I am using one of the support CS skins, which I&rsquo;ve made a few subtle modifications to (only 1 skin file and some CSS overrides), which is cake for me to maintain.&nbsp; Going to make a few more adjustments, since I&rsquo;m not sure if I like some things like the header yet.&nbsp; Additionally, I am working on adapting the PoisonIvy skin for the blogs for the Galleries.&nbsp; It is mostly done, but still needs a little refining.</p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also moved my blog to the root.&nbsp; It was kind of pointless having a separate landing page, since it was so out-dated and there are only really two parts of the site that had regular content&hellip; my blog and my gallery.&nbsp; So now, that is all it is.&nbsp; Anything else will probably be entered as an article or something, so CS maintains it.&nbsp; I setup a redirector from /blog/, so any old blog links should still work just fine.&nbsp; Still need to add a few static pages back someplace, such as the SiteUrls generator for CS v1.1.</p>


<p>At any rate, just trying to have a simpler site that I can easily keep up-to-date with the latest builds.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
