      <h2>Some shots from over the weekend...</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Finally got my new Sigma 30mm f/1.4 last Wednesday and was playing around with it some more over the weekend.&nbsp; First thing is it is quite a bit heavier than the kit lens, and with the lens hood on, it looks quite menacing, even for a 30mm prime.&nbsp; However, it is a great lens!&nbsp; Very sharp, excellent low light performance.&nbsp; On Saturday, we went to this crab feed at my wife&rsquo;s old church in Lodi and was taking a few shots there (before my battery inadvertently died, oops).&nbsp; Most of the shots were a little blurry, since I had drank a couple of glasses of wine, but some of friends were like, &ldquo;wow, you don&rsquo;t need the flash at all?!?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nope, but even at 1/30&ndash;1/60 sec shutter speed, I wasn&rsquo;t doing too well handheld.&nbsp; Here are a couple of shots from over the weekend though.&nbsp; First two are from the crab feed of my brother-in-law and father-in-law, and the third is my wife lounging on the couch on Sunday.</p>
