  <li>Improved Editor - simple to use WYSIWYG editor.</li>
  <li>Improved blog authoring experience - simplified workflow for creating, editing, and saving posts.</li>
  <li>Improved comment editing/management tools for blogs - designed to help you edit and manage a large number of comments quickly.</li>

      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>

        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
