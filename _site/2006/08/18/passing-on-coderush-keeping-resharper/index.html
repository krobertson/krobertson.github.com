      <h2>Passing on CodeRush, keeping ReSharper</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>After reading some of the <a href="http://www.larkware.com/NewReviews/coderush2.aspx">reviews on CodeRush</a>, and finally getting around to seeing Scott Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmanDeveloperProductivityToolsVideoPart4.aspx">Developer Productivity Tools 4 video</a>, I decided to finally give <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/">CodeRush</a>&nbsp;a try.</p>


<p> <p>On the surface and in the videos, it looks really cool.&nbsp; It has a great collection of templates and its visual indicators are great.&nbsp; I love how it visualizes breaks/returns, how it helps visualize different code blocks, and everything about it is excellent.&nbsp; I could totally see myself leveraging and enjoying all that it has to offer.</p> <p>The problem though, is that it lacks a number of features from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> that I have come to depend on.&nbsp; Right after I opened a project and was trying CodeRush, I was messing around with code and changed the name of a variable on a line.&nbsp; I paused for a second, expecting the name to turn red because it didn't exist, but it didn't.&nbsp; I added some code and realized I was missing a using, and it didn't prompt me.&nbsp; I then manually used 'us&lt;space&gt;' and 'usx&lt;space&gt;' to add some using clauses, and it didn't tell me when I had some references I didn't need.&nbsp; Right away, I missing something.&nbsp; While CodeRush is a strong templating engine, it lacks what I love so much about ReSharper... its live evaluation of the code and syntax highlighting.&nbsp; I love being aware of errors before I go to compile.&nbsp; I love its side bar indicating where all of the errors and warnings are in the current document.&nbsp; I love its navigation features, being able to quickly find all references to a method/property/variable.&nbsp; Some of them are features that are in Visual Studio without ReSharper, but ReSharper simply makes them better.</p> <p>I suppose I thought I'd enjoy CodeRush because it looked new and exciting, and since I've been using ReSharper for 2 years already, I had become so used to it that the line of what features were ReSharper and which were Visual Studio had been blurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd right click to look for "Find Usages Advanced" and say to myself, "Ohh yeah, that was a part of ReSharper".</p> <p>If I had found CodeRush before ReSharper, I would have loved it and probably come to depend on it as much as I have with ReSharper.&nbsp; However, I've instead become dependent upon ReSharper.&nbsp; If in a future version, they add some of the things like live code analysis, then I will definitely give it another try, though for now, my first love is still ReSharper.</p></p>
