      <h2>Coming Soon: Trunks</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>Wanted to take a moment to announce a project that I've been progressively working on over the past year, and hope to finally open up soon.</p>


<p>Hosted source control is a market that has really exploded in the past 18 months, with a number of providers and options out there.  I'm a huge fan of source control for all code, whether big or small, but with most of the offerings, I found something lacking.  There wasn't really a service that could meet all of my needs.  After dwelling on it for a while, started to figure out what I was really looking for and decided to turn the idea into a reality.</p>


<p>Trunks started out as a realization of a few core difference between what was out there and what I was looking for.</p>


<ul>
    <li>Many other services are opinionated about their source control tool, but the feature set people are looking for in a service are the same regardless of the tool.  Additionally, people often use multiple tools.  I use git for my ruby development, but subversion for most of my .NET development.  I don't want to have to pay for two separate services.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>Most developers are tinkerers.  They work on stuff here and there and have an ever growing collection of code and projects.  I believe all code should be under source control and never thrown out, but over time I'd be paying more and more with other services due to the number of repositories.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>Some of the services sell to companies more than individuals and are loaded up with other features.  A lot of hosted source control services are bundled with extensive project management, focused around teams and collaboration on the team.  I just wanted plain and simple source control.</li>
</ul>


<p>This has lead to three of the driving ideals in Trunks:</p>


<ul>
    <li>SCM agnostic.  Trunks currently supports Subversion, Git, and Mercurial, with support for Bazaar also in the works.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>Unlimited private repositories.  And based on focusing on individuals and their growing projects, I am still on the fence about even having public repositories (open to feedback).</li>
</ul>


<ul>
    <li>Just source control.  I do plan on some very basic issue tracking (a numbered todo list?), but nothing fancy.  It should just be plain simple to use, pretty to look at, stable, and reliable.</li>
</ul>


<p>More details will be coming.  I've had the service up and running for almost a year, but have been sitting on it to figure out what I really wanted to do with it.  I recently started dusting it off and diving back into it, polishing the points I liked and removing the annoyances I found while just using it for a few months.  Hopefully over the next couple of weeks, I'll feel confident in it enough to go to a private beta and really start kicking its tires.</p>


<p>Keep tuned for more!</p>
