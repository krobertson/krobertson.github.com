      <h2>Awesome virtual server hosting</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>For a while now, I've run a small virtual server business, hosted on a couple of servers that I own in a local Sacramento datacenter.</p>




<p>Currently, I'm looking for a few additional customers.  I don't actively recruit, however looking to fill some extra capacity I have.</p>




<p>Some information:</p>




<ul>
    <li>Windows Server 2008 or any linux distro available.</li>
    <li>Virtualization with XenServer 5.</li>
    <li>Low load servers, not oversold or overcommitted.</li>
    <li>Top quality bandwidth.  I don't like crappy connectivity.  Currently get bandwidth through XO and Verizon, soon moving to a new datacenter with Level3 and XO.</li>
    <li>Hardware firewall and hosted anti-spam solution.</li>
    <li>Shared SQL Server 2005 (soon to be moved to 2008) server</li>
    <li>Manage your sites with DotNetPanel, email with SmarterMail</li>
    <li>All servers are Dell PowerEdge 1950s, 2x quad core processors, 8-16gb RAM (upgrading all to 16gb soon)</li>
</ul>




<p>Some other important points:</p>




<ul>
    <li>Your virtual server is your own responsibility.  You break IIS, you fix it!</li>
    <li>No set limits for number of domains/email accounts, but be reasonable.</li>
</ul>




<p>I usually cater to a more technical crowd.  Developers can appreciate the quality, understand they get what they pay for, and are pretty much self-managing.  My current users really don't come to me for that much.</p>




<p>Plans are either:</p>




<ul>
    <li>512mb RAM</li>
    <li>20gb space</li>
    <li>150gb bandwidth</li>
    <li>$50/month for Linux, $70/month for Windows</li>
</ul>




<p>Or,</p>




<ul>
    <li>1024mb RAM</li>
    <li>40gb space</li>
    <li>300gb bandwidth</li>
    <li>$100/month for Linux, $120/month for Windows</li>
</ul>




<p>Space is limited, as I only have a couple servers.  I'm not buying any additional ones, so not going beyond my current capabilities.  Once the space fills up, it is done.</p>




<p>Hosting with me is not right for everyone.  If you need a lot of support, then it may be better to look elsewhere.  I don't run this as a full-on business where I cater to all the customers needs.  That said, if you know what you're doing, want a quality virtual server on quality hardware and connectivity, then I'm just what you're looking for.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
