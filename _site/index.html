  <h2><a href="/2011/01/19/love-your-dependency-management/">Love your dependency management</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>Dependency management is a pain in the ass, but it doesn't have to be.</p>

<p>Last month we went through a full migration of all of our systems to a new provider.  This is truly awesome to do when you have all your systems spec'd out and managed with chef, however it can also highlight those areas you might have been lazy or where you didn't enforce your chef specs enough.  We managed to catch a few places where a smaller satellite app had newer system gems installed and not documented in its readme or in our chef specs.</p>

<p>Managing gems is one of those areas that you find varying opinions, but I've definitely fallen in love with <a href="http://gembundler.com">bundler</a> over the past year.  I use it on all my personal projects, but it becomes even more valuable when used within a team of developers.  Need to change a gem?  Just do it and notify everyone to run bundle install.  Often times, bundler will actually tell them they need to update if it sees changes.  Time to deploy your changes?  That is all you do... deploy them!</p>

<p>Before, we had a mixture of vendored gems and system gems depending on whether some were using C extensions or needed to have system binaries.  But by moving these applications to use bundler, the only gem chef needs to install is bundler itself.</p>

<p>The easing of the process for both sides is awesome... both for the devs and for operations.</p>

<p>Tired of your own gem deploy or dependency management woes?  Take a look... wouldn't hurt.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/12/08/progress-through-iterating/">Progress through iterating</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>It was a little over a year ago that I launched the public beta of Trunks, and when talking with a friend was looking back at all the revisions it has gone though.  Although its only been live a year, I've actually been working on the project for 3 years now and I'm on the 4th major revision of its codebase.</p>

<p>The projects that are most fulfilling long-term are those that you have a vested interest in.  Often times, they're beyond purely financial.  I have never gauged Trunk's success on its profits, rather it is an idea that I myself find value in, and believe others do as well.  That is why I've stuck with it over time.</p>

<p>Each major revision has addressed problem areas of the previous and has gotten incrementally better and more mature.  When looking back, can clearly see the problem points of the previous version and how they were addressed.  It is important to look back to see the path you've traveled.  Be aware of the mistake you've already addressed so as to not re-introduce them.  And if nothing else, feel proud of the investment you've made in the project and you own growth.</p>

<p>I had basically forgotten I'd been working on Trunks for 3 years.  After being reminded, was looking at it and thinking damn, its come a long way.</p>

  <div class="main">
    <p>I started typing a follow up post about my experiences with vim, but then as I was adding a line about not throwing gasoline on the holy war that I was doing exactly that.  I was creating the stereotypical holy war inflamatory post.</p>

<p>My main point in the previous post was about finding the tools that worked best for you, and ignoring the FUD from everyone else.</p>

<p>So with that, I spent a week with vim, watched several screencasts, pulled in several plugins, and gave it a solid week of not using emacs and resisting TextMate.  At the end of that week, I've decided I'm more at home in emacs.</p>

<p>The reasons are basically mute, especially since I'm trying to push for people to find out for themselves.  It is counter intuitive to give a now slanted opinion while telling you to ignore it.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/10/14/tool-enlightenment/">Tool Enlightenment</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>Recently, I decided to take a journey down the path of enlightenment.</p>

<p>One of the things I found so refreshing about Ruby/Rails when I first started using it was the simplicity of the tooling.  Just use a text editor, no monolithic IDE with large memory footprints, slow load times, and a panache for crashing.</p>

<p>Visual Studio certainly is a great tool, and provides some powerful tools to .NET.  But I doubt anyone would disagree with me that Visual Studio often feels like a 500lb gorilla. Especially when you add in the plugins so many use, like CodeRush or ReSharper.  Simply opening TextMate was rather refreshing when coming from that kind of environment.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I had the chance to go to <a href="http://gogaruco.com">GoGaRuCo</a> and they had a workflow panel where they got some of the well known developers up on the stage, and discussed some of the tools and arrangements they use.  It was a little superficial, where it was "I have an editor with 3 panes and 2 terminals open".  But there were some interesting observations.  First of all, everyone on the panel was using either Emacs or Vim.  After the talk, they polled the audience what they use.  The overwhelming majority of the audience was using either RubyMine or TextMate.</p>

<p>The surface argument you could make is that all the "hackers" are using Emacs/Vim and aren't representative of the population.  Sure, I looked at it that way too.  But a few things started to peak my interest, particularly when I'd talk to an Emacs or Vim user.  You will almost always hear them say they've been using it for 10 years, 15 years, or sometimes even longer.</p>

<p>Think about your toolset today and your toolset 10 years ago.  Is there <i>anything</i> that you're still using?  If so many people will stick with the same tool for 10 years, spanning technology bubbles, and crossing over to new languages, there must be something that tool is doing right.  These are tools whose users invest in them.  They're like marriages.</p>

<p>So my journey to enlightenment has begun with looking at Emacs, however I'm not just playing eenie-meenie-miney-moe. Both Emacs and Vim have large followings are both excellent choices. The way I see it, I can't chose which direction to go without looking both ways.  So, I'm trying both for 1-2 weeks each, play around with building my .emacs and vimrc, and see where it leads.</p>

<p>I've been using Emacs for almost 2 weeks now, and find myself opening stuff up in TextMate less and less.  Next week, I plan to focus more on Vim and try it out.</p>

<p>But I think the true enlightenment that can be found is... the elite tools are not what the "hacker" portion of a community use.  Use what fits your style best, understand why you've chosen your tools, and recognize those same decisions in the tools used by those around you.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/10/08/involver-team-and-matz/">Involver Team and Matz</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto was speaking yesterday at the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> offices in San Francisco on what is coming in Ruby 2.0.  Was a great time and was a pleasure to meet Matz in person.  I love to meet people who have changed the industry, but still remain humble.  He was very polite, thanking us for coming, shaking hands, meanwhile everyone was thanking him for Ruby.</p>

<p>One of the great question after the presentation was someone asking him what it is like having, basically, changed development and how it felt when he first realized it was catching on.  Matz said that time was around when the first picaxe book came out.  It was having someone other than himself writing an English book about Ruby and it selling well.  But his general answer to what it was like was "its nice".</p>

<p><img src="http://invalidlogic-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/100_0098_2.jpg" alt="" title="100_0098_2" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-609" /></p>

<p>The Involver team had the opportunity to take a bit of a team photo with him.  This represents about a quarter of the total Involver Engineering team.  Here we have <a href="http://twitter.com/zedlander">@zedlander</a>, Jaime our System Overlord, myself, Nina our QA queen, and <a href="http://twitter.com/zquestz">@zquestz</a> (aka Josh) who just started this week.  <a href="http://twitter.com/nolamn">@nolman</a> was also there, but had to take off right after the talk.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.0 will have a number of small but very nice language improvements, such as keyword arguments (similar to what .NET 4.0 added), as well as the ability to namespace things, including monkey patching that is scoped to only the namespace.  That there is something that seems like it will bring a lot of power.  Use two libraries that use two different versions of a gem?  What if you could load them in separate namepaces, each utilizing the separate gem versions.  Perhaps you could get really crazy and have a Rails 2 and Rails 3 app running together using separate namespaces.  I don't know why anyone would do that, but you could, and that I like.</p>

<p>Ruby 2.0 will see a large emphasis on embedded and an alternative VM/interpretter for more targeted implementations.  I would love it if we could have a setup similar to the Arudio or Neturdio that ran Ruby.  Matz was talking about bringing Ruby to places like digital appliances, more RTOS environments focusing on latency instead of throughput.  Or having Ruby implementations for the cloud that utilized a smaller subset of the language to run on more targeted hardware.  Distributed processing where perhaps computational power is more important than IO or what not.</p>

<p>My first thought... in a few years, could my DVR be running a Rails web interface?</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/09/16/you-got-rvm-and-git-in-my-command-prompt/">You got RVM and git in my command prompt!</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>I had posted this to our internal wiki at work, but <a href="http://twitter.com/scottw">Scott</a> had mentioned he <a href="http://twitter.com/scottw/status/24492462082">was interested in it</a>, so figured I'd throw it up here.</p>

<p>Zsh is the best shell.  If you don't know, <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">now you know</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that is a nice convenience is to setup the command prompt to include your current Ruby implementation, RVM gemset, and which branch of the git repository you are in.  In our main codebase at Involver, my prompt looks like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100916-r1s8h53qw3pc718fnb4fnrsefy.jpg" alt="prompt" width="496" height="84" /></div>


<p>From this, I can tell I'm using JRuby 1.5.1, the "involver" gemset.  I'm in the "topsecret" project folder (I just have the current directory, not the full path), and the "git:master" indicates its a git repository and I'm in the master branch.</p>

<p>To achieve that, add the following into your .zshrc or one of the files you source into it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> parse_git_branch() {
<span class="lineno"> 2</span>   git branch 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e &#39;/^[^*]/d&#39; -e &#39;s/* \(.*\)/\/git:\1/&#39;
<span class="lineno"> 3</span> }
<span class="lineno"> 4</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 5</span> rvm_prompt() {
<span class="lineno"> 6</span>   $HOME/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt v g
<span class="lineno"> 7</span> }
<span class="lineno"> 8</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 9</span> export PS1=&#39;%{$reset_color$fg[blue]%}$(rvm_prompt)%{$reset_color$fg[gray]%}:
<span class="lineno">10</span> %1~%{$reset_color$bold_color$fg[green]%}%{$reset_color$fg[green]%}
<span class="lineno">11</span> $(parse_git_branch)&gt;%{$reset_color%} &#39;
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>There are of course many more things you can do with zsh.  I have this and other tidbits in my <a href="http://github.com/krobertson/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a> on Github.  And now that I think of it, have some stuff I haven't checked in since I'm not in TextMate/Ruby/zsh all day.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/09/08/the-future-of-papercut/">The Future of Papercut</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>It has been three months since I moved to doing Ruby full time, and it has been three months since I've written any .NET.  This is a trend that will likely continue as I'm no longer writing .NET day to day.  However, I don't want one of my babies, <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/">Papercut</a>, to die a neglectful death.</p>

<p>Papercut isn't really a large codebase and doesn't have a laundry list of problems or anything, but it does have a list of feature requests that I know I won't have the time to get to.  So I am looking for someone to take over maintenance of it.</p>

<p>With open source, it is easy enough for anyone to fork the code and run with it, but people still tend to be drawn to the official codebase and site for the latest updates.  The problem with looking for people to take over is that you can't necessarily hand it off to just anyone.  In many ways, it is like applying for a job.  You can't just say "ohh, I'll do it!" since the bigger question is are you capable of doing it.</p>

<p>The ideal person would be someone who:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Has experience with .NET socket development.</li>
    <li>Understands the SMTP protocol, or can read and make sense of protocol RFCs.</li>
    <li>Understands MIME format enough to work with it.</li>
    <li>Be good to have a basic understanding of asynchronous IO and threading/managed thread pools.</li>
</ul>


<p>This isn't an absolute list, but more of a wish list or a list of what you should expect.  Most of the feature requests for Papercut involve extending it to support more MIME functionality and bugs will often require troubleshooting the networking code or threading, which can be very different than traditional web or GUI apps.</p>

<p>Anyone who is interested, please email me at ken@invalidlogic.com.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2010/08/30/a-personal-retrospective/">A Personal Retrospective</a></h2>

  <div class="main">
    <p>I'd heard of people applying agile methodologies to their lives through things like personal kanban.  I recently decided to apply another practice: retrospectives.  Sounds simple, but when I thought about it, it really isn't that often that I sit down and take stock of where I am and have action items at the end of it.</p>

<p>The idea is simple.  Get away from distractions for a while.  Grab a whiteboard, piece of paper, or whatever you have.  Mark out three columns.  In the first, list the things that have been going well or that you like about where you are in life.  In the second, list the things you don't like.  And in the final, come up with a resolution or first action item for each of the things you don't like.</p>

<p>The goal of it is to acknowledge what has been going well, figure out what hasn't, and get the ball rolling on tackling those.  Just like you do with your projects!</p>

<p>I am by no means an agile expert, or a super organized, together person.  But I was thinking about how it has been 3 months since making a rather big career change and wanted to take stock of how things have gone, but personally and not just professionally.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself and see how it goes.  For me, I think a 3 month rotation is about right.</p>
