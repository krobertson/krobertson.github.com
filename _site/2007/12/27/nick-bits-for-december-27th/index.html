      <h2>Nick Bits for December 27th</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>It has been over a month since I did <a _tesavedurl="http://qgyen.net/archive/nick-bits-for-november-16th/" href="http://qgyen.net/archive/nick-bits-for-november-16th/">my last Nick Bits</a>, so figured I was due for another.</p>


<ul>
    <li>As of today, Nick is now three months old!</li>
    <li>He was really cute when he <a _tesavedurl="http://photos.qgyen.net/gallery/3958721#229991439" href="http://photos.qgyen.net/gallery/3958721#229991439">dressed up like Santa</a></li>
    <li>Sleeping through the night!&nbsp; After we got back from the Telligent Christmas Party almost two weeks ago, he started sleeping through the night (or about 10am til 5:30-6am).&nbsp; He is also starting to have more regular nap times and be up more between them.</li>
    <li>He is smiling up a storm and talking like crazy now.&nbsp; He doesn't really talk in words, but loves being talked to and makes all kinds of noise back.</li>
    <li>That said, he does have one &quot;word&quot;&nbsp; He uses the word &quot;agee&quot;, which when he says it, sounds like of like &quot;hungry&quot; and he only makes the sound when he is hungry.</li>
    <li>He has now found his hand and loves sucking on it.&nbsp; Kind of funny to watch, since he will go to town.</li>
    <li>Nick enjoyed his first Christmas!&nbsp; While he doesn't know who Santa is yet, he will definitely have a ton of fun next year.&nbsp; He made out pretty well this year, finally getting some toys (most toys are like 6mos+, and only a few for 3mo or newborn).&nbsp; But he now has a playmat and a nice collection of noise makers to entertain him.</li>
</ul>
