      <h2>Another hobby of mine: servers</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>One of my other hobbies (for quite a while) has been monkeying around with hardware.&nbsp; Years ago, I used to always be changing the hardware in my computer, planning a new system, etc.&nbsp; I used to try to buy low, sell high, and basically would replace something in my computer every few months.</p>


<p> <p>That all pretty much came to a halt once I started a full-time job.&nbsp; When your computer is your bread and butter, you don&#39;t want to deal with the downtime involved with rebuilding your OS whenever you replace motherboards, or the reliability when experimenting with different hardware.&nbsp; So at that time, it started shifting more towards servers and server management.&nbsp; For&nbsp;a long time, I had a server colocated with this idea &quot;I can do some hosting for others then so it will cost me less.&quot;&nbsp; The problem?&nbsp; (1) Never got around to getting everything setup for that kind of thing, (2) I like control over my server, wary of giving just anybody access to stuff.&nbsp; So it never happened, and a while ago, I pulled the server from colocation.</p> <p>At one point, I had this grand idea of doing a hosting business, though luckily, I eventually woke up.&nbsp; Reality is that hosting is a low profit, high support, cut-throat market.&nbsp; Your <em>average user</em> (not necessarily all) expects top-tier support for dirt cheap prices, and they will drop you at any point just to save a buck.&nbsp; There are users who realize you get what you pay for, but even then, the hosting market is huge, and while there is plenty of room, it doesn&#39;t necessarily make it easy to differentiate unless you make a full go at it, and reality is I prefer working at Telligent.</p> <p>But I still have this server hobby...</p> <p>Thus, it brings me to my latest way of handling it.&nbsp; Virtual servers.&nbsp; Virtual servers are great... split a single larger server into multiple smaller ones, everyone gets to do their own thing.&nbsp; As a whole, virtual servers cost more (since they give you more).&nbsp; You have fewer people per box (so less individuals to deal with) and higher income per customer.&nbsp; Additionally, if you price it right, you get a better crowd.&nbsp; Your &quot;average user&quot; doesn&#39;t need a VPS and wouldn&#39;t pay for one.&nbsp; Higher end people often like virtual servers though.&nbsp; These are you techie people who know what they&#39;re doing, want more control than shared hosting, and are willing to pay a bit more for it.&nbsp; Since they are techies, they don&#39;t really need any support other than getting access to it.&nbsp; Other than that, they can pretty much handle themselves.</p> <p>So where do I come in?&nbsp; I&#39;ve recently setup a virtual server hosting a series of machines that I can sell out to others.&nbsp; Benefit to others is that it is a very nice box, with low population (most hosts squeeze on as many as they can to the detriment of others), and without the price of a lot of other hosts (I don&#39;t do 24x7 phone support or any of that crap, so don&#39;t need to charge for it).&nbsp; The benefit to me is that it supports my server hobby.</p> <p>Where do you come in?&nbsp; I am probably going to have a few slots open for virtual servers and will offer them for sale.&nbsp; But there are a few things to lay out.</p> <ol> <li>Not doing it as a regular business where the more customers the merrier.&nbsp; Once I am where I want to be, not taking any more.  <li>This is in no way, shape form, similar galaxy, or anything having to do with Telligent itself.&nbsp; There is no special CS support because I am on the CS team.&nbsp; If it is a server issue, I&#39;ll address it, if it is common issue, I&#39;ll make a suggestion, if it beyond that, post on the CS forums.  <li>Say again, no 24x7 support, or anything.&nbsp; And I&#39;d tell people to look elsewhere if I don&#39;t feel I can support them they way they want to be and the way I want to. <li>Cheaper doesn&#39;t mean cheap.&nbsp; I&#39;d said can offer similar virtual servers for less, but that doesn&#39;t mean really cheap.&nbsp; Having things like lower support saves money, but having a low server population, quality hardware, and a premium datacenter add a few bucks.&nbsp; The &quot;get what you pay for&quot; rule still applies.&nbsp; Sure, you don&#39;t get&nbsp;a ton of support, but thus far, I&#39;ve been finding the quality of service to be beyond your common offer.&nbsp; <a href="http://community.reszler.org/">Just</a> <a href="http://dbvt.com/blog/archive/2007/03/11/dbvt-com-is-relocated-baby.aspx">ask</a>.</li></ol> <p>When will I be selling my remaining virtual server slots?&nbsp; Once I get all the wrinkles ironed out.&nbsp; Even though I gave myself 2-3 weeks to get the box set up, and it has been hosted for about a week and a half, still a few minor annoyances to correct and automate (ie, copying IIS logs to SmarterStats, automatically adding domains to the spam filter, etc).&nbsp; Once I am ready, I think I will only have about 5 virtual servers available.</p></p>

        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
