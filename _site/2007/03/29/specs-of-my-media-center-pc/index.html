      <h2>Specs of my Media Center PC</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p><a href="http://danhounshell.com/blogs/dan/">Dan Hounshell</a>&nbsp;was curious what the specs were on my Media Center PC, so I thought I&#39;d go over it some.</p>


<p> <p>My new box is absolutely rocking so far.&nbsp; Overall, it has 4 tuners in it (2 standard cable, 2 HD), so we can essentially record up to 4 shows at once.&nbsp; The main advantage is with the dual HD tuners, since we often times want to record two primetime dramas that are on at the same time (ie, wife likes Smallville, I like CSI, and CBS is funky in Sacramento where CSI is at 8 instead of 9).</p> <p><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo T5500</p> <blockquote> <p>After the older socket 478 Pentium 4 died, figured I should get a modern CPU.&nbsp; I went with the T-series Core 2 Duo since it is the mobile series.&nbsp; Uses about half the power as the desktop series, and is about the same price.&nbsp; For Media Center, heat is more important than speed... it doesn&#39;t need a <em>ton</em> of power, and a dual core would fit nicely with Media Center.&nbsp; The main thing is you want the PC quiet, so a mobile CPU will use far less power.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Asus N4L-VM DH</p> <blockquote> <p>I always prefer Asus motherboards, and this is the &quot;mobile on desktop&quot; motherboard in Asus&#39; offerings.&nbsp; Overall, it is a very nice board.&nbsp; Main pluses are passively cooled, mATX (fits smaller cases), integrated digital optical/coaxial outputs, 1x PCIe x16, 1x PCIe x1, and 2x PCI.&nbsp; Only thing I don&#39;t like is the PCIe x1 is right next to the PCIe x16, so the two cards kind of rub against each other since the video card has a larger heatsink.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>RAM:</strong> 2GB DDR2 (2x 1GB)</p> <blockquote> <p>Nothing real big here.&nbsp; Just using Kingston&#39;s Value series RAM.&nbsp; I don&#39;t spend big bucks for top-end high-speed RAM.&nbsp; Just get the regular stuff, from a name brand, and it works perfectly.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Video Card:</strong> GeForce 7600GS 256mb</p> <blockquote> <p>This is kind of a mid-ranged video card.&nbsp; Latest chipset, but not the one with all the bells and whistles.&nbsp; Provides good power consumption with pretty good performance.&nbsp; I went more on the side of consumption that performance.&nbsp; Also, it is passively cooled.&nbsp; This means less fans for less noise, though still need to pay attention to airflow in the case to ensure it isn&#39;t just sitting in dead air.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Standard Tuner:</strong> Huappauge WinTV-PVR-500MCE</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a very nice dual-tuner PCI card.&nbsp; With this card, you get two tuners in one, so you can record two things, or record one thing and watch another at the same time.&nbsp; You <em>can</em> use two single-tuner cards, but with that you will be using more slots (on an mATX motherboard, don&#39;t have a lot of room for expansion) and using two cards will mean more power consumption, so more heat.&nbsp; Very nice card, great quality, well recommended.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>HD Tuner:</strong> Vbox Cat&#39;s Eye 164e</p> <blockquote> <p>Similar to my standard tuner, this is the only dual-tuner HD card on the market.&nbsp; It is my newest component (other than the stuff that died) since I wasn&#39;t content with just a single HD tuner.&nbsp; I had one of Vbox&#39;s single HD tuner cards and liked it, and so far this one has been performing well (though the Vista drivers are still somewhat beta).&nbsp; I definitely wanted two HD tuners as we watch a number of network dramas, and HD is just awesome.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Burner:</strong> Plextor DVD-R/+R/CD-RW Burner</p> <blockquote> <p>Not sure exactly which model this is, but just a basic Plextor burner that I&#39;ve had for a while.&nbsp; Had a nice dual layer SATA Plextor burner in it a while ago and it died.&nbsp; So bought my desktop a new dual layer burner and put the older single layer burner from my desktop in the Media Center PC.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t really need a dual layer, I don&#39;t burn much on it, mainly just play DVDs or CDs.&nbsp; Probably hold out for a HD-DVD drive when they are actually reasonably priced.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Coolmax &quot;EZ Wire&quot; 400w</p> <blockquote> <p>This is one component that may be upgraded next... if needed.&nbsp; I don&#39;t need more power, and certainly don&#39;t need 400w, but it works well.&nbsp; Coolmax isn&#39;t really one of the main name brands (in my opinion at least) but it seems to work ok so far.&nbsp; One thing I do like that is being done on more and more power supplies is the modular cabling.&nbsp; Instead of having that mess of unused cabling you need to tuck away somewhere, you only plug in the branches that you need, so you don&#39;t have that left over bundle.&nbsp; Works great to cut down on the clutter.&nbsp; Less clutter means cleaner layout and better airflow.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Case:</strong> OrigenAE H6 (Silver)</p> <blockquote> <p>These days, you can go pretty crazy with HTPC cases, as they have ones with built in touchscreen LCD displays and such.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really need anything like that.&nbsp; I just want a simple case that will match style of my stereo receiver and not be an ugly beige PC case.&nbsp; I am not a big fan of the SilverStone cases (my old one was a SilverStone, didn&#39;t care for it).&nbsp; This case has a built in LCD (just a little character one, not the full color graphical ones) and an IR module.&nbsp; The LCD works pretty good, but the IR is a little funky, and doesn&#39;t burst as well as the default MCE IR receiver,&nbsp;but overall the case is much better.&nbsp; Pretty good hard drive mounts with rubber grommets, grommets on the fan by the hard drives, very light weight, well laid out.&nbsp; Only complaints are would be nice if it has some rubber shims for the rear fans.&nbsp; It didn&#39;t have a fan spot on the side opposite the hard drives, but I was able to cut out of a hole for a 80mm fan and add one there.&nbsp; The case is very simple and has an appealing look though.&nbsp; I like it.</p></blockquote> <p>Main thing I am still working on fleshing out is the system monitoring.&nbsp; Just recently got the system how I want it, so just now moving over to concentrating on the software.&nbsp; Also need to look into adding the ability to get fan reporting on the additional fans.</p></p>
