      <h2>Back to the grind!</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>I kid, it isn&#39;t really a grind, though today is my first day back to work after my two weeks paternity leave.&nbsp; My time off was not nearly as productive as I thought it would be.&nbsp; Honestly, I think I had this glorified image of it as some nice time off and was going to work on some little coding projects, like trying out Silverlight and such, but absolutely none of that happened.&nbsp; The time was pretty much just spent taking care of Nick and trying to sleep.</p>


<p> <p>As of today, Nick is now two weeks old and he had his first doctor&#39;s appointment.&nbsp; At birth, he was 7lbs 15oz and 19&quot;, after birth he dropped to about 7lbs 11oz, and as of today, he is 8lbs 4oz and 20 1/8&quot;.&nbsp; Doctor said everything is look good with him.&nbsp; Belly button is almost healed, his snip-snip is all healed.</p> <p>At nights, Nick is starting to do really well.&nbsp; He has a trained, I guess.&nbsp; We found he likes sleeping in his papasan more than his basinet, since it props him up more and also kind of wraps him, rather than him being flat on his back in the basinet.&nbsp; Lately he has been going 2 hours between feedings, and starting to get to 3 hours, and he sleeps nice and quiet between feedings.&nbsp; Works out very well for us, since we get nice 2-3 hour blocks of sleep.</p> <p>We&#39;ve also been starting to take Nick outside some.&nbsp; On Sunday he went to church and brunch with us.&nbsp; He was awake for quite awhile and then just passed out and slept through brunch.&nbsp; The other day, we went out to get&nbsp;a Halloween costume for him, and he just slept soundly.&nbsp; Then today he went out to the doctor and was basically awake the whole time.</p> <p>The past few days, he has been starting to stay awake more and is starting to hold his head up on his own, looking all around.&nbsp; He is very curious about his environment, and seems to be conscious of colors.&nbsp; At the doctors office, behind me was a board with a bunch of colors and he was all captivated by it.&nbsp; He seems to like my office&nbsp;a lot too, especially when I have the ceiling fan on.&nbsp; It is kind of nice too as he actually looks at us.</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
