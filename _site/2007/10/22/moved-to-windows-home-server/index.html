      <h2>Moved to Windows Home Server</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>It was <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/11/20/Should-have-got-a-NAS-device-a-long-time-ago.aspx">not even a year ago</a> that I setup my home NAS server complete with RAID, however now I am abandoning it.&nbsp; Previously, I had <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2007/03/30/windows-home-server-s-idea-of-redundancy.aspx">disliked Windows Home Server&#39;s idea of redundancy</a>, however some recent events with my not-as-trust <a href="http://www.infrant.com/products/products_details.php?name=ReadyNAS%20NV">Infrant ReadyNAS NV</a> have changed my opinion.</p>


<p> <p>About two months ago, I had a little issue with my NAS storage box.&nbsp; I was out over town over the weekend and when I came home, I found that the unit was off.&nbsp; No power had gone out, since no clocks were blinking, but the box was off, and when I pushed the power button, it wouldn&#39;t turn on.&nbsp; Took it out from behind my monitors, blew out the dust, and then it worked.&nbsp; Was confused why that fixed it, but hey, it was working again.&nbsp; However, over the next week, I started smelling something occasionally in my office that smelled like burning potatoes.&nbsp; It smelled like it was coming from my ceiling fan (though turns out it was the ceiling fan blowing down the bad smell it pulled up from the NAS area)... after a week of having the NAS back up, it was broke again, and this time for good.</p> <p>It turned out it was just a blown power supply, and it was somewhat common the model I had.&nbsp; I ended up fixing it by popping out its proprietary PSU and replacing it with a normal big-ass ATX PSU, since I found all you needed to do for them to be compatible was snip a little wire it didn&#39;t use (used a cheap spare PSU I had laying around).&nbsp; This brought up several problems with this type of box though.</p> <p>First, it is entirely proprietary.&nbsp; Custom power supply, custom hardware, custom build of some Linux distribution, integrated RAID controller... nothing is end-user swappable.&nbsp; Compare that with a home-PC based storage system.&nbsp; Dead PSU?&nbsp; Ok, run to Fry&#39;s, by a new one, done.&nbsp; Dead motherboard?&nbsp; Get another.&nbsp; Dead CPU?&nbsp; Get another.&nbsp; Some may be bigger headaches to get up and going, but for the most part, no need to RMA the entire unit.</p> <p>While it supports RAID for hard drive redundancy, everything else about the unit is a closed box.&nbsp; When the unit was broken, there was <em>no way</em> for me to access my data.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t plug the drives into another system.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t pull the controller out and access the array on another system.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Your data gets locked to that device.&nbsp; To get access to your data, you have to get the device running again.&nbsp; This sucks when you store all your important data on there.</p> <p>All this made me take another look at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx">Windows Home Server</a>.&nbsp; Its idea of redundant storage is to just keep two copies of the file.&nbsp; Have a hard drive die?&nbsp; No problem, it can rebalance its storage and ensure another copy of that data is somewhere.&nbsp; Want to add more drives?&nbsp; No problem, plug them in (can&#39;t exactly do that once you have all 4 drives in on the NAS solution).&nbsp; With its &quot;two copies&quot; idea, it is basically RAID1, but without the dependence on a RAID controller.&nbsp; Say you have a total system failure with WHS and need access to some of your data.&nbsp; All you have to do is plug that drive into another system.&nbsp; It is just a regular NTFS partition with some special directory structure.&nbsp; Just go to the drive, Shares, Photos, and boom, there is the Photos share.&nbsp; Additionally, even though you will get 1/2 your drive capacity with the &quot;two copies&quot; method, you have to face one ever growing reality... storage is cheap!&nbsp; Run out of space?&nbsp; It is pretty easy and rather inexpensive to add another drive.&nbsp; You can get a 500gb hard drive for ~$100 nowadays... so for $200, you have 500gb of redundant storage with WHS.&nbsp; $0.40 a gigabyte?&nbsp; Not too shabby.</p> <p>On top of that, I can now backup all the PCs in my house nice and easily (as opposed to buying several copies of Acronis TrueImage).</p> <p>What&#39;s next?&nbsp; Maybe when I find some free time, I&#39;ll write up a little add-in to WHS to support remote off-site backups with rsync or some other continuous backup software.</p></p>
