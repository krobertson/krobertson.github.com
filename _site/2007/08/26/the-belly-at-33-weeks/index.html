      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
