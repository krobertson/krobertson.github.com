      <h2>Value of site monitoring</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>As it has been <a href="http://qgyen.net/archive/2007/10/17/datacenter-fun.aspx">previously establish</a>, I handle a couple of servers and a small network in a Sacramento datacenter.&nbsp; I had set up all kinds of internal monitoring on bandwidth, server health, etc.&nbsp; But one thing I never did before was to setup external monitoring.&nbsp; Site monitoring can be invaluable to help manage your site and the services you use.</p>


<p> <p>The reality, things do go down from time to time.&nbsp; Most of the time it is for maintenance purposes (or at least, it <em>should</em> be).&nbsp; However sometimes, things do go wrong.&nbsp; Having quality site monitoring gives you instant notification (if it is something you can handle), history of information on outages, and can even help you keep a provider tied to their Service Level Agreement.</p> <p>I recently signed up for monitoring with <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>, which offers attractive pricing for multi-site monitoring (since one location is never enough), and also monitoring with checks at 1 minute.&nbsp; These are two important points.</p> <p>First, most others will offer ever 5 minutes standard, or you can pay extra for 2 minutes.&nbsp; 1 minute resolution gives you the absolute fastest notification, and can pickup the smallest outages.&nbsp; With 5 minutes, you could almost reboot a server in that time.&nbsp; That is a definite outage, but it could completely miss it.</p> <p>The second important thing is multi-site monitoring.&nbsp; This is a necessity.&nbsp; Over the weekend, my server had its first actual network issue.&nbsp; It was outside of my control, but basically, I get access from two providers: Qwest and Verizon Business.&nbsp; Verizon was having some network issues in the Sacramento area that was causing traffic coming in through them to be dropped, but traffic from Qwest was fine.&nbsp; This caused a sort of brown out.&nbsp; Server was accessible depending on which route traffic was coming in from.&nbsp; With site monitoring that only checked from a single location, it could show the site as operating just fine.&nbsp; However Pingdom offers like 7 worldwide locations they check from.&nbsp; This allows for high certainty of its accuracy.</p> <p>On top of that, you can purchase additional service checks for only $0.50/month, so I have all my main services monitored, and even several of my upstream provider&#39;s services monitored, so in the event this happens again, I&#39;ll clearly know if it is within my network, upstream, and narrow it down right away.</p> <p>May sound like a commercial, though Pingdom really is quite cool.&nbsp; They even give response times on all checks for some basic historical performance data.</p></p>
