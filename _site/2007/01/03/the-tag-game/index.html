      <h2>The Tag Game</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>I&#39;ve been seeing this phenom going around the blogosphere, and was safe up until today.&nbsp; <a href="http://scottwater.com/">Scott</a> <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/five-things-you-are-dyning-to-know-about-me.aspx">tagged</a> me.</p>


<p> <ol> <li>In the sixth grade, I played baseball for one year, and only one year.&nbsp; I had a .000 batting average, though the baseball cards they made and sent to us had .300 because&nbsp;hadn&#39;t turned in my batting stats.&nbsp; Despite not being a good batter, I did make one clinch outfield play in one game, though later told my coach my eyes were closed when I was catching the ball. </li><li>My dad used to tell me that I should go into graphic design, that the future boom was in graphic design.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a graphic artist though, my art is code, so I went into programming. </li><li>I came close to never meeting my wife.&nbsp; Originally, I didn&#39;t want to go to CSU Sacramento, I was dead set on Cal Poly San Louis Obispo.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t get accepted for the fall term at SLO, so my only other option was to apply and go in the summer semester, but I didn&#39;t want to give up my summer break, so I went to CSUS instead.&nbsp; If I hadn&#39;t have done that, I would have never met my wife.  </li><li>In high school, I was earning nearly $40/hour.&nbsp; My dad owns a machine shop and I used to work for him in the summer.&nbsp; I mostly put these little pins in little test sockets.&nbsp; He extended the same pay scale as his other employees to me: 2 cents per pin.&nbsp; But only did pins (while the others did them in their spare time), and I eventually was able to consistently do 2,000 pins an hour.&nbsp; I used to only work like 2-3 days a week, and would cap myself at about 8,000 pins a day.&nbsp; Was boring work, but good money for being in high school.  </li><li>During my freshman year in college, I was living in the dorms and the boyfriend of one of the Resident Advisors asked me if I could hack into the school computers and change a grade for him.&nbsp; He was serious too.&nbsp; I told him it doesn&#39;t work like they do it in the movies.</li></ol> <p>So now, who to tag?</p> <p>How about <a href="http://community.reszler.org/blogs/wizz/default.aspx">Rick Rezler</a>, <a href="http://richmercer.com/default.aspx">Rich Mercer</a>, <a href="http://eduncan911.com/default.aspx">Eric Duncan</a>, <a href="http://jasona.net/default.aspx">Jason Alexander</a> (because he never blogs), and <a href="http://soup.co.za/weblog/default.aspx">Jaxon Rice</a> (he never blogs anymore either).</p></p>

        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
