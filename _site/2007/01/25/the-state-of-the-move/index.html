      <h2>The State of the Move</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>So, I&#39;d mentioned last week how I was going to be moving.&nbsp; Well, almost a week later, and this where we are:</p>


<p> <ul> <li>Moved in, though was a very long day.&nbsp; Moving out of a third floor apartment?&nbsp; Not fun.&nbsp; Moving out of&nbsp;a third floor apartment with just myself, my cousin, and two 50+ guys to move furniture?&nbsp; Definitely not fun.&nbsp; The absolute worst were my two (2!) desks.&nbsp; They are both big, heavy, and difficult to get through doors and down stairs.</li> <li>The day after the move, went back to get my computer and some odds and ends.&nbsp; My arms were already killing me, and I had no grip (I could barely pull up my socks!), but after that, I was limping around as my legs were sooo sore.</li> <li>After moving on Saturday, and picking some additional things on Sunday, Monday I managed to come down with this stomach flu type thing.&nbsp; It has been going around like wild fire.&nbsp; My nephew had it, then my other nephew, then my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, then Trish&#39;s grandmother, then I caught it, and my dad caught it.&nbsp; My dad and I didn&#39;t have it quite the same, but too much of a coincidence.&nbsp; Will spare further details, but not fun.&nbsp; Exhausted + sore + so much to do + don&#39;t ask symptoms.</li> <li>Comcast got cable TV up on Sunday, and internet on Monday... gave me a bad modem and self-install kit on Sunday without sticking around to make sure it worked... well, modem was bad.</li> <li>Ohh yeah, how is this: I got a paper cut under my thumbnail.&nbsp; Talk about sucks.&nbsp; Was opening the shrinkwrap on the self install kit the way I normally do... run your thumbnail along it.&nbsp; Well, I guess I pressed too hard, and got a papercut under my nail.</li> <li>Cleaned out old apartment, including some carpet cleaning (why put carpeting around the dining room?).</li> <li>More unpacking than I want to think about (and still more)</li> <li>Growing list of &quot;home improvement&quot; projects (running another phone line, running Cat5 cable to living room, putting up some better lighting in the garage, etc)... even though we don&#39;t own the house, going to be here a while, and some of them are pretty cheap.</li></ul> <p>Back at work now, with the computer all set up.&nbsp; Office isn&#39;t back to normal just yet, but all the essentials are in place.</p></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="textwidget">
        This is the personal blog of Ken Robertson.  I'm a developer at <a href="http://involver.com/">Involver</a> working in Ruby/Rails.  In a former life, I worked in .NET for many years and since moved on.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now, I get to make Rails scale, cook all day long with chef, and experiment with building highly concurrent systems.<br/>
        <br/>
        In my spare time, I like to build things.  I like to experiment with different technologies to find how they best fit onto my utility belt.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes blog.  You'll find those things here.<br/>
        <br/>
        I sometimes code.  You'll find those on <a href="http://github.com/krobertson">Github</a>.<br/>
