      <h2>The State of the Move</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>So, I&#39;d mentioned last week how I was going to be moving.&nbsp; Well, almost a week later, and this where we are:</p>


<p> <ul> <li>Moved in, though was a very long day.&nbsp; Moving out of a third floor apartment?&nbsp; Not fun.&nbsp; Moving out of&nbsp;a third floor apartment with just myself, my cousin, and two 50+ guys to move furniture?&nbsp; Definitely not fun.&nbsp; The absolute worst were my two (2!) desks.&nbsp; They are both big, heavy, and difficult to get through doors and down stairs.</li> <li>The day after the move, went back to get my computer and some odds and ends.&nbsp; My arms were already killing me, and I had no grip (I could barely pull up my socks!), but after that, I was limping around as my legs were sooo sore.</li> <li>After moving on Saturday, and picking some additional things on Sunday, Monday I managed to come down with this stomach flu type thing.&nbsp; It has been going around like wild fire.&nbsp; My nephew had it, then my other nephew, then my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, then Trish&#39;s grandmother, then I caught it, and my dad caught it.&nbsp; My dad and I didn&#39;t have it quite the same, but too much of a coincidence.&nbsp; Will spare further details, but not fun.&nbsp; Exhausted + sore + so much to do + don&#39;t ask symptoms.</li> <li>Comcast got cable TV up on Sunday, and internet on Monday... gave me a bad modem and self-install kit on Sunday without sticking around to make sure it worked... well, modem was bad.</li> <li>Ohh yeah, how is this: I got a paper cut under my thumbnail.&nbsp; Talk about sucks.&nbsp; Was opening the shrinkwrap on the self install kit the way I normally do... run your thumbnail along it.&nbsp; Well, I guess I pressed too hard, and got a papercut under my nail.</li> <li>Cleaned out old apartment, including some carpet cleaning (why put carpeting around the dining room?).</li> <li>More unpacking than I want to think about (and still more)</li> <li>Growing list of &quot;home improvement&quot; projects (running another phone line, running Cat5 cable to living room, putting up some better lighting in the garage, etc)... even though we don&#39;t own the house, going to be here a while, and some of them are pretty cheap.</li></ul> <p>Back at work now, with the computer all set up.&nbsp; Office isn&#39;t back to normal just yet, but all the essentials are in place.</p></p>
