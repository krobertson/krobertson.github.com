      <h2>Some updates around here</h2>

<div class="main">
  <p>So if you actually visit my site, might notice it looks a little difference.&nbsp; For starters, using a new skin.&nbsp; I found this nice little <a href="http://templates.arcsin.se/">web template</a> and turned it into a CS skin.</p>


<p> <p>The big change around here is that I am now running the latest build of CS 3.0.&nbsp; One of the best ways to flesh out annoyances and bugs is to use your own software.&nbsp; So, putting 3.0 to some live use.&nbsp; Mainly want to find some stuff around emails notifications and such.</p> <p>Skinning in CS 3.0 is actual a pleasure.&nbsp; For this skin, I actually got it all written in a couple of hours back in November.&nbsp; Just a few hours.&nbsp; You no longer have the hoards of of skin files and everything.&nbsp; You have just your main masterpage file and then 4-5 individual page files for things like viewing a list of posts, viewing a post, contact page, etc.&nbsp; To get it working with the latest code, just had to go back into it and update two skin references.&nbsp; Major goal with 3.0 is to make skins forward compatible, so surprised there was so few changes needed as we were still developing the new system.</p> <p>Additionally, the power of the skins is greatly increased.&nbsp; You can now do conditional skinning.&nbsp; IE, for the number of comments, it can say &quot;no comments&quot;, &quot;1 comment&quot;, or &quot;2 comments&quot;... can even do &quot;no comments&quot;, &quot;one comment&quot;, &quot;2 comments&quot;, etc.&nbsp; You can tell it &quot;if field X equals Y then show Z&quot;.</p> <p>Like the new skin, though already noticing how its width will be&nbsp;a problem.&nbsp; Have trouble even posting code snippets or something.&nbsp; But, was a nice project one night, and wanted to put it out there for a bit.&nbsp; Maybe release the skin once we get a beta build of CS 3.0 out.</p></p>
